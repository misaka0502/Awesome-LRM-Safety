| 2025-05-20 | [Mind the Gap: Bridging Thought Leap for Improved Chain-of-Thought Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14684v1) | Haolei Xu, Yuchen Yan et al. | Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on mathemati-cal tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, existing mathematical CoT datasets often suffer from Thought Leaps due to experts omitting intermediate steps, which negatively impacts model learning and generalization. We propose the CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task, which aims to automatically detect leaps and generate missing intermediate reasoning steps to restore the completeness and coherence of CoT. To facilitate this, we constructed a specialized training dataset called ScaleQM+, based on the structured ScaleQuestMath dataset, and trained CoT-Bridge to bridge thought leaps. Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on bridged datasets consistently outperform those trained on original datasets, with improvements of up to +5.87% on NuminaMath. Our approach effectively enhances distilled data (+3.02%) and provides better starting points for reinforcement learning (+3.1%), functioning as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing optimization techniques. Furthermore, CoT-Bridge demonstrate improved generalization to out-of-domain logical reasoning tasks, confirming that enhancing reasoning completeness yields broadly applicable benefits. |
| 2025-05-20 | [Emerging Properties in Unified Multimodal Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14683v1) | Chaorui Deng, Deyao Zhu et al. | Unifying multimodal understanding and generation has shown impressive capabilities in cutting-edge proprietary systems. In this work, we introduce BAGEL, an open0source foundational model that natively supports multimodal understanding and generation. BAGEL is a unified, decoder0only model pretrained on trillions of tokens curated from large0scale interleaved text, image, video, and web data. When scaled with such diverse multimodal interleaved data, BAGEL exhibits emerging capabilities in complex multimodal reasoning. As a result, it significantly outperforms open-source unified models in both multimodal generation and understanding across standard benchmarks, while exhibiting advanced multimodal reasoning abilities such as free-form image manipulation, future frame prediction, 3D manipulation, and world navigation. In the hope of facilitating further opportunities for multimodal research, we share the key findings, pretraining details, data creation protocal, and release our code and checkpoints to the community.

Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks. |
| 2025-05-20 | [Reward Reasoning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14674v1) | Jiaxin Guo, Zewen Chi et al. | Reward models play a critical role in guiding large language models toward outputs that align with human expectations. However, an open challenge remains in effectively utilizing test-time compute to enhance reward model performance. In this work, we introduce Reward Reasoning Models (RRMs), which are specifically designed to execute a deliberate reasoning process before generating final rewards. Through chain-of-thought reasoning, RRMs leverage additional test-time compute for complex queries where appropriate rewards are not immediately apparent. To develop RRMs, we implement a reinforcement learning framework that fosters self-evolved reward reasoning capabilities without requiring explicit reasoning traces as training data. Experimental results demonstrate that RRMs achieve superior performance on reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. Notably, we show that RRMs can adaptively exploit test-time compute to further improve reward accuracy. The pretrained reward reasoning models are available at https://huggingface.co/Reward-Reasoning. |
| 2025-05-20 | [SAFEPATH: Preventing Harmful Reasoning in Chain-of-Thought via Early Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14667v1) | Wonje Jeung, Sangyeon Yoon et al. | Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become powerful tools for complex problem solving, but their structured reasoning pathways can lead to unsafe outputs when exposed to harmful prompts. Existing safety alignment methods reduce harmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant trade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak attacks. To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight alignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at the start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the rest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while maintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful responses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than Direct Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot variant that requires no fine-tuning. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to reasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer AI. |
| 2025-05-19 | [Trust, But Verify: A Self-Verification Approach to Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13445v1) | Xiaoyuan Liu, Tian Liang et al. | Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement strategy. However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where models fail to robustly verify their own outputs. We introduce RISE (Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework designed to tackle this. RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a single, integrated RL process. The core mechanism involves leveraging verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for both solution generation and self-verification tasks. In each iteration, the model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update. Extensive experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently fostering strong self-verification skills. Our analyses highlight the advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification compute. Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate self-verification behaviors during reasoning. These advantages reinforce RISE as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware reasoners. |
| 2025-05-19 | [GraspMolmo: Generalizable Task-Oriented Grasping via Large-Scale Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13441v1) | Abhay Deshpande, Yuquan Deng et al. | We present GrasMolmo, a generalizable open-vocabulary task-oriented grasping (TOG) model. GraspMolmo predicts semantically appropriate, stable grasps conditioned on a natural language instruction and a single RGB-D frame. For instance, given "pour me some tea", GraspMolmo selects a grasp on a teapot handle rather than its body. Unlike prior TOG methods, which are limited by small datasets, simplistic language, and uncluttered scenes, GraspMolmo learns from PRISM, a novel large-scale synthetic dataset of 379k samples featuring cluttered environments and diverse, realistic task descriptions. We fine-tune the Molmo visual-language model on this data, enabling GraspMolmo to generalize to novel open-vocabulary instructions and objects. In challenging real-world evaluations, GraspMolmo achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 70% prediction success on complex tasks, compared to the 35% achieved by the next best alternative. GraspMolmo also successfully demonstrates the ability to predict semantically correct bimanual grasps zero-shot. We release our synthetic dataset, code, model, and benchmarks to accelerate research in task-semantic robotic manipulation, which, along with videos, are available at https://abhaybd.github.io/GraspMolmo/. |
| 2025-05-19 | [Optimizing Anytime Reasoning via Budget Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13438v1) | Penghui Qi, Zichen Liu et al. | Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency. |
| 2025-05-19 | [KinTwin: Imitation Learning with Torque and Muscle Driven Biomechanical Models Enables Precise Replication of Able-Bodied and Impaired Movement from Markerless Motion Capture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13436v1) | R. James Cotton | Broader access to high-quality movement analysis could greatly benefit movement science and rehabilitation, such as allowing more detailed characterization of movement impairments and responses to interventions, or even enabling early detection of new neurological conditions or fall risk. While emerging technologies are making it easier to capture kinematics with biomechanical models, or how joint angles change over time, inferring the underlying physics that give rise to these movements, including ground reaction forces, joint torques, or even muscle activations, is still challenging. Here we explore whether imitation learning applied to a biomechanical model from a large dataset of movements from able-bodied and impaired individuals can learn to compute these inverse dynamics. Although imitation learning in human pose estimation has seen great interest in recent years, our work differences in several ways: we focus on using an accurate biomechanical model instead of models adopted for computer vision, we test it on a dataset that contains participants with impaired movements, we reported detailed tracking metrics relevant for the clinical measurement of movement including joint angles and ground contact events, and finally we apply imitation learning to a muscle-driven neuromusculoskeletal model. We show that our imitation learning policy, KinTwin, can accurately replicate the kinematics of a wide range of movements, including those with assistive devices or therapist assistance, and that it can infer clinically meaningful differences in joint torques and muscle activations. Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning to enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice. |
| 2025-05-19 | [A Practical Guide for Incorporating Symmetry in Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13431v1) | Dian Wang, Boce Hu et al. | Recently, equivariant neural networks for policy learning have shown promising improvements in sample efficiency and generalization, however, their wide adoption faces substantial barriers due to implementation complexity. Equivariant architectures typically require specialized mathematical formulations and custom network design, posing significant challenges when integrating with modern policy frameworks like diffusion-based models. In this paper, we explore a number of straightforward and practical approaches to incorporate symmetry benefits into diffusion policies without the overhead of full equivariant designs. Specifically, we investigate (i) invariant representations via relative trajectory actions and eye-in-hand perception, (ii) integrating equivariant vision encoders, and (iii) symmetric feature extraction with pretrained encoders using Frame Averaging. We first prove that combining eye-in-hand perception with relative or delta action parameterization yields inherent SE(3)-invariance, thus improving policy generalization. We then perform a systematic experimental study on those design choices for integrating symmetry in diffusion policies, and conclude that an invariant representation with equivariant feature extraction significantly improves the policy performance. Our method achieves performance on par with or exceeding fully equivariant architectures while greatly simplifying implementation. |
| 2025-05-16 | [Bracing for Impact: Robust Humanoid Push Recovery and Locomotion with Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11495v1) | Lizhi Yang, Blake Werner et al. | Push recovery during locomotion will facilitate the deployment of humanoid robots in human-centered environments. In this paper, we present a unified framework for walking control and push recovery for humanoid robots, leveraging the arms for push recovery while dynamically walking. The key innovation is to use the environment, such as walls, to facilitate push recovery by combining Single Rigid Body model predictive control (SRB-MPC) with Hybrid Linear Inverted Pendulum (HLIP) dynamics to enable robust locomotion, push detection, and recovery by utilizing the robot's arms to brace against such walls and dynamically adjusting the desired contact forces and stepping patterns. Extensive simulation results on a humanoid robot demonstrate improved perturbation rejection and tracking performance compared to HLIP alone, with the robot able to recover from pushes up to 100N for 0.2s while walking at commanded speeds up to 0.5m/s. Robustness is further validated in scenarios with angled walls and multi-directional pushes. |
| 2025-05-16 | [SHIELD: Safety on Humanoids via CBFs In Expectation on Learned Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11494v1) | Lizhi Yang, Blake Werner et al. | Robot learning has produced remarkably effective ``black-box'' controllers for complex tasks such as dynamic locomotion on humanoids. Yet ensuring dynamic safety, i.e., constraint satisfaction, remains challenging for such policies. Reinforcement learning (RL) embeds constraints heuristically through reward engineering, and adding or modifying constraints requires retraining. Model-based approaches, like control barrier functions (CBFs), enable runtime constraint specification with formal guarantees but require accurate dynamics models. This paper presents SHIELD, a layered safety framework that bridges this gap by: (1) training a generative, stochastic dynamics residual model using real-world data from hardware rollouts of the nominal controller, capturing system behavior and uncertainties; and (2) adding a safety layer on top of the nominal (learned locomotion) controller that leverages this model via a stochastic discrete-time CBF formulation enforcing safety constraints in probability. The result is a minimally-invasive safety layer that can be added to the existing autonomy stack to give probabilistic guarantees of safety that balance risk and performance. In hardware experiments on an Unitree G1 humanoid, SHIELD enables safe navigation (obstacle avoidance) through varied indoor and outdoor environments using a nominal (unknown) RL controller and onboard perception. |
| 2025-05-16 | [Improving Assembly Code Performance with Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11480v1) | Anjiang Wei, Tarun Suresh et al. | Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO, achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3 baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code performance. |
| 2025-05-16 | [Automatic Reward Shaping from Confounded Offline Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11478v1) | Mingxuan Li, Junzhe Zhang et al. | A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures. Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved confounders exist. |
| 2025-05-16 | [UMArm: Untethered, Modular, Wearable, Soft Pneumatic Arm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11476v1) | Runze Zuo, Dong Heon Han et al. | Robotic arms are essential to modern industries, however, their adaptability to unstructured environments remains limited. Soft robotic arms, particularly those actuated pneumatically, offer greater adaptability in unstructured environments and enhanced safety for human-robot interaction. However, current pneumatic soft arms are constrained by limited degrees of freedom, precision, payload capacity, and reliance on bulky external pressure regulators. In this work, a novel pneumatically driven rigid-soft hybrid arm, ``UMArm'', is presented. The shortcomings of pneumatically actuated soft arms are addressed by densely integrating high-force-to-weight-ratio, self-regulated McKibben actuators onto a lightweight rigid spine structure. The modified McKibben actuators incorporate valves and controllers directly inside, eliminating the need for individual pressure lines and external regulators, significantly reducing system weight and complexity. Full untethered operation, high payload capacity, precision, and directionally tunable compliance are achieved by the UMArm. Portability is demonstrated through a wearable assistive arm experiment, and versatility is showcased by reconfiguring the system into an inchworm robot. The results of this work show that the high-degree-of-freedom, external-regulator-free pneumatically driven arm systems like the UMArm possess great potential for real-world unstructured environments. |
| 2025-05-15 | [3D-Fixup: Advancing Photo Editing with 3D Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10566v1) | Yen-Chi Cheng, Krishna Kumar Singh et al. | Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models, 3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames, we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in realistic image manipulation. The code is provided at https://3dfixup.github.io/ |
| 2025-05-15 | [Beyond 'Aha!': Toward Systematic Meta-Abilities Alignment in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10554v1) | Zhiyuan Hu, Yibo Wang et al. | Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning, boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines. Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhiyuanhubj/Meta-Ability-Alignment |
| 2025-05-15 | [Loop closure grasping: Topological transformations enable strong, gentle, and versatile grasps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10552v1) | Kentaro Barhydt, O. Godson Osele et al. | Grasping mechanisms must both create and subsequently hold grasps that permit safe and effective object manipulation. Existing mechanisms address the different functional requirements of grasp creation and grasp holding using a single morphology, but have yet to achieve the simultaneous strength, gentleness, and versatility needed for many applications. We present "loop closure grasping", a class of robotic grasping that addresses these different functional requirements through topological transformations between open-loop and closed-loop morphologies. We formalize these morphologies for grasping, formulate the loop closure grasping method, and present principles and a design architecture that we implement using soft growing inflated beams, winches, and clamps. The mechanisms' initial open-loop topology enables versatile grasp creation via unencumbered tip movement, and closing the loop enables strong and gentle holding with effectively infinite bending compliance. Loop closure grasping circumvents the tradeoffs of single-morphology designs, enabling grasps involving historically challenging objects, environments, and configurations. |
| 2025-05-15 | [Observing Bethe strings in an attractive Bose gas far from equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10550v1) | Milena Horvath, Alvise Bastianello et al. | Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems. |
| 2025-05-15 | [Real-Time Out-of-Distribution Failure Prevention via Multi-Modal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10547v1) | Milan Ganai, Rohan Sinha et al. | Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data, i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation. |

| 2025-05-14 | [DataMIL: Selecting Data for Robot Imitation Learning with Datamodels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09603v1) | Shivin Dass, Alaa Khaddaj et al. | Recently, the robotics community has amassed ever larger and more diverse datasets to train generalist robot policies. However, while these policies achieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often underperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on newly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully curated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better specialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream performance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data selection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data selection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which data points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that filter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual similarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success, allowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that degrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during selection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data, allowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We validate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world manipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the Open X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and superior performance over multiple baselines. Our results underscore the importance of end-to-end, performance-aware data selection for unlocking the potential of large prior datasets in robotics.

| 2025-05-14 | [Real2Render2Real: Scaling Robot Data Without Dynamics Simulation or Robot Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09601v1) | Justin Yu, Letian Fu et al. | Scaling robot learning requires vast and diverse datasets. Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

Lin et al.~showed that the set of tropical Fermat-Weber points might not be contained in the space of ultrametrics on $[p]$ even if all input data points are in the space. Here we consider a more general set up and we focus on Fermat-Weber points with respect to the tropical metric over the Bergman fan associated with a matroid with the ground set of $q$ elements. We show that there always exists a Fermat-Weber point in the Bergman fan for data in the Bergman fan and we describe explicitly the set of all Fermat-Weber points in the Bergman fan. Then we introduce the natural extension of the safety radius introduced by Atteson to the set of Fermat-Weber points in the Bergman fan of a matroid. |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Vision-Tactile-Language-Action model, a novel framework that enables robust policy generation in contact-intensive scenarios by effectively integrating visual and tactile inputs through cross-modal language grounding. A low-cost, multi-modal dataset has been constructed in a simulation environment, containing vision-tactile-action-instruction pairs specifically designed for the fingertip insertion task. Furthermore, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to offer regression-like supervision for the VTLA model, effectively bridging the gap between classification-based next token prediction loss and continuous robotic tasks. Experimental results show that the VTLA model outperforms traditional imitation learning methods (e.g., diffusion policies) and existing multi-modal baselines (TLA/VLA), achieving over 90% success rates on unseen peg shapes. Finally, we conduct real-world peg-in-hole experiments to demonstrate the exceptional Sim2Real performance of the proposed VTLA model.

As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the interactions and responses appear more "human-like" than those of previous versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated. Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning, and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative AI chatbots. |

However, applying this ability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent differences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance and physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using cross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned data between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills successfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen video prompts.

Traditional UQ methods rely on specifying a true generative model and are not robust to misspecification. On the other hand, conformal inference allows for arbitrary ML models but does not consider model selection, which leads to large interval sizes. We tackle these drawbacks by proposing a UQ method based on the predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science proposed by Yu and Kumbier. Specifically, PCS-UQ addresses model selection by using a prediction check to screen out unsuitable models. PCS-UQ then fits these screened algorithms across multiple bootstraps to assess inter-sample variability and algorithmic instability, enabling more reliable uncertainty estimates. Further, we propose a novel calibration scheme that improves local adaptivity of our prediction sets. Experiments across $17$ regression and $6$ classification datasets show that PCS-UQ achieves the desired coverage and reduces width over conformal approaches by $\approx 20\%$. Further, our local analysis shows PCS-UQ often achieves target coverage across subgroups while conformal methods fail to do so. For large deep-learning models, we propose computationally efficient approximation schemes that avoid the expensive multiple bootstrap trainings of PCS-UQ. Across three computer vision benchmarks, PCS-UQ reduces prediction set size over conformal methods by $20\%$. Theoretically, we show a modified PCS-UQ algorithm is a form of split conformal inference and achieves the desired coverage with exchangeable data. |
| 2025-05-13 | [Full-volume aberration-space holography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08777v1) | Ian Christen, Christopher Panuski et al. | Simultaneous, diffraction-limited control of multiple optical beams is crucial for applications ranging from lithography to optogenetics, deep tissue imaging, and tweezer-based manipulation of cells, particles, or atoms. Despite the desire to address wider fields of view, deeper volumes, and increasingly-disordered media, spatially-varying aberrations currently restrict parallelized steering to a limited "isoplanatic" region over which the point spread function is invariant. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining individual propagation kernels accounting for site-specific aberrations into a single spatial light modulator (SLM) hologram. This "aberration-space holography" unlocks precise, parallel holographic shaping over the SLM's entire Nyquist-limited volume, enabling us to realize full-field, anisoplanatic aberration compensation for the first time. By simultaneously correcting 50 isoplanatic patches with 8 principal aberration modes, we demonstrate a full-field optical tweezer array with 8x larger field of view than the best isoplanatic correction. Extending to 3D, we increase the volume of a multiphoton volumetric display by 12x. These performance enhancements are immediately accessible to a diverse range of applications through our open-source software implementation, which combines aberration-space holography with automated experimental feedback, wavefront calibration, and alignment. |

Arora, Jason Wei et al. | We present HealthBench, an open-source benchmark measuring the performance and safety of large language models in healthcare. HealthBench consists of 5,000 multi-turn conversations between a model and an individual user or healthcare professional. Responses are evaluated using conversation-specific rubrics created by 262 physicians. Unlike previous multiple-choice or short-answer benchmarks, HealthBench enables realistic, open-ended evaluation through 48,562 unique rubric criteria spanning several health contexts (e.g., emergencies, transforming clinical data, global health) and behavioral dimensions (e.g., accuracy, instruction following, communication). HealthBench performance over the last two years reflects steady initial progress (compare GPT-3.5 Turbo's 16% to GPT-4o's 32%) and more rapid recent improvements (o3 scores 60%). Smaller models have especially improved: GPT-4.1 nano outperforms GPT-4o and is 25 times cheaper. We additionally release two HealthBench variations: HealthBench Consensus, which includes 34 particularly important dimensions of model behavior validated via physician consensus, and HealthBench Hard, where the current top score is 32%. We hope that HealthBench grounds progress towards model development and applications that benefit human health. |
| 2025-05-13 | [Generative Molecular Design with Steerable and Granular Synthesizability Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08774v1) | Jeff Guo, VÃ­ctor Sabanza-Gil et al. | Synthesizability in small molecule generative design remains a bottleneck. Existing works that do consider synthesizability can output predicted synthesis routes for generated molecules. However, there has been minimal attention in addressing the ease of synthesis and enabling flexibility to incorporate desired reaction constraints. In this work, we propose a small molecule generative design framework that enables steerable and granular synthesizability control. Generated molecules satisfy arbitrary multi-parameter optimization objectives with predicted synthesis routes containing pre-defined allowed reactions, while optionally avoiding others. One can also enforce that all reactions belong to a pre-defined set. We show the capability to mix-and-match these reaction constraints across the most common medicinal chemistry transformations. Next, we show how our framework can be used to valorize industrial byproducts towards de novo optimized molecules. Going further, we demonstrate how granular control over synthesizability constraints can loosely mimic virtual screening of ultra-large make-on-demand libraries. Using only a single GPU, we generate and dock 15k molecules to identify promising candidates in Freedom 4.0 constituting 142B make-on-demand molecules (assessing only 0.00001% of the library). Generated molecules satisfying the reaction constraints have > 90% exact match rate. Lastly, we benchmark our framework against recent synthesizability-constrained generative models and demonstrate the highest sample efficiency even when imposing the additional constraint that all molecules must be synthesizable from a single reaction type. The main theme is demonstrating that a pre-trained generalist molecular generative model can be incentivized to generate property-optimized small molecules under challenging synthesizability constraints through reinforcement learning. |

However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains $\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$ average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be released. |
| 2025-05-12 | [Pixel Motion as Universal Representation for Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07817v1) | Kanchana Ranasinghe, Xiang Li et al. | We present LangToMo, a vision-language-action framework structured as a dual-system architecture that uses pixel motion forecasts as intermediate representations. Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a self-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on web-scale video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

| 2025-05-12 | [Imagine, Verify, Execute: Memory-Guided Agentic Exploration with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07815v1) | Seungjae Lee, Daniel Ekpo et al. | Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations. |

While teleoperation provides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead, what if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to collect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to collect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects. To record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and easy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and robot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on each dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies capable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with minimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that DexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in unseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot data only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization.

Oppeneer et al. | Ultrashort optical pulses are a cornerstone for manipulating electronic and magnetic states in materials on a femtosecond timescale. Conventional models assume that optical excitation primarily modifies the occupation of the electron energy levels without long-lasting altering of the coupling of individual electrons in certain processes. Here, we demonstrate that optical excitation with two femtosecond pulses that come from different directions fundamentally transforms the electron dynamics in copper, affecting the efficiency of angular momentum transfer between electrons and the lattice. Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, we reveal a ~2.5. increase in spin imbalance decay time following inverse Faraday effect excitation under dual-pump conditions compared to single-pulse excitation. This observation challenges the prevailing paradigm of ultrafast light-matter interactions, showing that dual optical excitation can transiently modify electron dynamics beyond simple changes in the energy levels occupancy. Our findings open new avenues for controlling quantum states through a dual pump approach, with implications for ultrafast spintronics and the design of novel light-driven states. |

Existing approaches often rely on prior scene knowledge or additional image captures and often develop policies that maximize coverage. Yet, for many real scenes with complex geometry and self-occlusions, coverage maximization does not lead to better reconstruction quality directly. In this paper, we propose the View Introspection Network (VIN), which is trained to predict the reconstruction quality improvement of views directly, and the VIN-NBV policy. A greedy sequential sampling-based policy, where at each acquisition step, we sample multiple query views and choose the one with the highest VIN predicted improvement score. We design the VIN to perform 3D-aware featurization of the reconstruction built from prior acquisitions, and for each query view create a feature that can be decoded into an improvement score. We then train the VIN using imitation learning to predict the reconstruction improvement score. We show that VIN-NBV improves reconstruction quality by ~30% over a coverage maximization baseline when operating with constraints on the number of acquisitions or the time in motion. |

Yu | Hiking on complex trails demands balance, agility, and adaptive decision-making over unpredictable terrain. Current humanoid research remains fragmented and inadequate for hiking: locomotion focuses on motor skills without long-term goals or situational awareness, while semantic navigation overlooks real-world embodiment and local terrain variability. We propose training humanoids to hike on complex trails, driving integrative skill development across visual perception, decision making, and motor execution. We develop a learning framework, LEGO-H, that enables a vision-equipped humanoid robot to hike complex trails autonomously. We introduce two technical innovations: 1) A temporal vision transformer variant - tailored into Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework - anticipates future local goals to guide movement, seamlessly integrating locomotion with goal-directed navigation. 2) Latent representations of joint movement patterns, combined with hierarchical metric learning - enhance Privileged Learning scheme - enable smooth policy transfer from privileged training to onboard execution. These components allow LEGO-H to handle diverse physical and environmental challenges without relying on predefined motion patterns. Experiments across varied simulated trails and robot morphologies highlight LEGO-H's versatility and robustness, positioning hiking as a compelling testbed for embodied autonomy and LEGO-H as a baseline for future humanoid development. |

Tenenbaum et al. | This article presents a concept-centric paradigm for building agents that can learn continually and reason flexibly. The concept-centric agent utilizes a vocabulary of neuro-symbolic concepts. These concepts, such as object, relation, and action concepts, are grounded on sensory inputs and actuation outputs. They are also compositional, allowing for the creation of novel concepts through their structural combination. To facilitate learning and reasoning, the concepts are typed and represented using a combination of symbolic programs and neural network representations. Leveraging such neuro-symbolic concepts, the agent can efficiently learn and recombine them to solve various tasks across different domains, ranging from 2D images, videos, 3D scenes, and robotic manipulation tasks. This concept-centric framework offers several advantages, including data efficiency, compositional generalization, continual learning, and zero-shot transfer. |

In robotics, active tactile perception has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task. These findings underscore the potential of TAP as a versatile and generalizable framework for advancing active tactile perception in robotics. |

Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments. |
| 2025-05-08 | [Generating Physically Stable and Buildable LEGO Designs from Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05469v1) | Ava Pun, Kangle Deng et al. | We introduce LegoGPT, the first approach for generating physically stable LEGO brick models from text prompts. To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over 47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed captions, along with our code and models at the project website: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/. |

We introduce SITE, a benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities (single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its performance on an embodied AI task. |

While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning (RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework, which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second, RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space. Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially less computational effort. |

We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice question answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we curate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with multiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves 85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which scores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy, EchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial interpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs. These results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning enhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to unify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning via reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate further research. |

To make it robust, multiple cameras are needed to expand the field of view. That is computationally challenging. Merging multiple views and using Q-learning allows the design of more effective representations and optimization of sample efficiency. Such a solution might be expensive to deploy. To mitigate this, we introduce a Merge And Disentanglement (MAD) algorithm that efficiently merges views to increase sample efficiency while augmenting with single-view features to allow lightweight deployment and ensure robust policies. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach using Meta-World and ManiSkill3. For project website and code, see https://aalmuzairee.github.io/mad |

Recent research has explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities by interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these approaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1) Uncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search engines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the training process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module capable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query. During RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that incrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively eliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly challenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B LLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves comparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module even surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and instruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms. |
| 2025-05-07 | [Active Sampling for MRI-based Sequential Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04586v1) | Yuning Du, Jingshuai Liu et al. | Despite the superior diagnostic capability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), its use as a Point-of-Care (PoC) device remains limited by high cost and complexity. To enable such a future by reducing the magnetic field strength, one key approach will be to improve sampling strategies. Previous work has shown that it is possible to make diagnostic decisions directly from k-space with fewer samples. Such work shows that single diagnostic decisions can be made, but if we aspire to see MRI as a true PoC, multiple and sequential decisions are necessary while minimizing the number of samples acquired. We present a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework enabling comprehensive, sequential, diagnostic evaluation from undersampled k-space data. Our approach during inference actively adapts to sequential decisions to optimally sample. To achieve this, we introduce a training methodology that identifies the samples that contribute the best to each diagnostic objective using a step-wise weighting reward function. We evaluate our approach in two sequential knee pathology assessment tasks: ACL sprain detection and cartilage thickness loss assessment.

By adjusting exercise difficulty for a specific user throughout the exercise interaction, robots can maximize both the user's rehabilitation outcomes and the their motivation throughout the exercise. Previous approaches have assumed exercises have generic difficulty values that apply to all users equally, however, we identified that stroke survivors have varied and unique perceptions of exercise difficulty. For example, some stroke survivors found reaching vertically more difficult than reaching farther but lower while others found reaching farther more challenging than reaching vertically. In this paper, we formulate a causal tree-based method to calculate exercise difficulty based on the user's performance. We find that this approach accurately models exercise difficulty and provides a readily interpretable model of why that exercise is difficult for both users and caretakers. |

However, achieving these capabilities on real humanoids remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom (DoF) and nonlinear dynamics. We propose Adaptive Motion Optimization (AMO), a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) with trajectory optimization for real-time, adaptive whole-body control. To mitigate distribution bias in motion imitation RL, we construct a hybrid AMO dataset and train a network capable of robust, on-demand adaptation to potentially O.O.D. commands. We validate AMO in simulation and on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating superior stability and an expanded workspace compared to strong baselines. Finally, we show that AMO's consistent performance supports autonomous task execution via imitation learning, underscoring the system's versatility and robustness. |

Arguably, the simplest way is to just show them-casually capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We introduce VIDEOMIMIC, a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday videos, jointly reconstructs the humans and the environment, and produces whole-body control policies for humanoid robots that perform the corresponding skills. We demonstrate the results of our pipeline on real humanoid robots, showing robust, repeatable contextual control such as staircase ascents and descents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches, as well as other dynamic whole-body skills-all from a single policy, conditioned on the environment and global root commands. VIDEOMIMIC offers a scalable path towards teaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world environments. |

Depending on the task, we might optimize for pose error, speed, collision, or similarity to a human demonstration. Motivated by this, we present PyRoki: a modular, extensible, and cross-platform toolkit for solving kinematic optimization problems. PyRoki couples an interface for specifying kinematic variables and costs with an efficient nonlinear least squares optimizer. Unlike existing tools, it is also cross-platform: optimization runs natively on CPU, GPU, and TPU. In this paper, we present (i) the design and implementation of PyRoki, (ii) motion retargeting and planning case studies that highlight the advantages of PyRoki's modularity, and (iii) optimization benchmarking, where PyRoki can be 1.4-1.7x faster and converges to lower errors than cuRobo, an existing GPU-accelerated inverse kinematics library. |

Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over prior TAMP approaches. |

However, the resilience of these systems to cyber-attacks and their adaptability to dynamic and constrained energy supplies remain largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a sustainable smart farm network designed to maintain high-quality animal monitoring under various cyber and adversarial threats, as well as fluctuating energy conditions. Our approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to devise optimal policies that maximize both monitoring effectiveness and energy efficiency. To overcome DRL's inherent challenge of slow convergence, we integrate transfer learning (TL) and decision theory (DT) to accelerate the learning process. By incorporating DT-guided strategies, we optimize monitoring quality and energy sustainability, significantly reducing training time while achieving comparable performance rewards. Our experimental results prove that DT-guided DRL outperforms TL-enhanced DRL models, improving system performance and reducing training runtime by 47.5%. |

While recent advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling. Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods. These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models, R1-Reward achieves a $8.4\%$ improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a $14.3\%$ improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs. |
| 2025-05-05 | [TWIST: Teleoperated Whole-Body Imitation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02833v1) | Yanjie Ze, Zixuan Chen et al. | Teleoperating humanoid robots in a whole-body manner marks a fundamental step toward developing general-purpose robotic intelligence, with human motion providing an ideal interface for controlling all degrees of freedom. Yet, most current humanoid teleoperation systems fall short of enabling coordinated whole-body behavior, typically limiting themselves to isolated locomotion or manipulation tasks. We present the Teleoperated Whole-Body Imitation System (TWIST), a system for humanoid teleoperation through whole-body motion imitation. We first generate reference motion clips by retargeting human motion capture data to the humanoid robot. We then develop a robust, adaptive, and responsive whole-body controller using a combination of reinforcement learning and behavior cloning (RL+BC). Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how incorporating privileged future motion frames and real-world motion capture (MoCap) data improves tracking accuracy. TWIST enables real-world humanoid robots to achieve unprecedented, versatile, and coordinated whole-body motor skills--spanning whole-body manipulation, legged manipulation, locomotion, and expressive movement--using a single unified neural network controller.

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance.   This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning.   Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data. |

Such couplings correspond to irrelevant Gaussian fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Their absence in the theory implies that different sectors of the gauge-Yukawa theory are secluded from one another, in similar fashion to the effects of a global or a discrete symmetry. As an example, we impose the trans-Planckian scale symmetry on a model of Grand Unification based on the gauge group SU(6), showing that it leads to the emergence of several fermionic WIMP dark matter candidates whose coupling strengths are entirely predicted by the UV completion. |
| 2025-05-05 | [Teaching the social media generation: rethinking learning without sacrificing quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02770v1) | Sepinoud Azimi | The rise of social media and AI tools has reshaped how students engage with learning, process information, and build trust in educational content. This generation prefers short, visual materials and fast feedback but often struggles with focus, critical thinking, and deep learning. Educators face the challenge of adapting teaching methods to these habits without lowering academic standards. This study presents a blended learning redesign of a first-year technical course at a Dutch university. Key features included short whiteboard videos before class, hands-on teamwork during class, narrative-style handouts to reinforce learning, in-class draft assignments without AI, and weekly anonymous feedback to adjust in real time. The results were promising: attendance increased by nearly 50%, and none of the regularly attending students failed the exam. Students found the videos useful but emphasized that in-person sessions were essential for understanding the material. While some resisted the shift in expectations, most appreciated the structure, clarity, and opportunities for active learning. This case suggests that combining digital familiarity with clear expectations and active support can help meet students where they are, while still challenging them to grow. |
| 2025-05-02 | [GENMO: A GENeralist Model for Human MOtion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01425v1) | Jiefeng Li, Jinkun Cao et al. | Human motion modeling traditionally separates motion generation and estimation into distinct tasks with specialized models. Motion generation models focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text, audio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate motion trajectories from observations like videos. Despite sharing underlying representations of temporal dynamics and kinematics, this separation limits knowledge transfer between tasks and requires maintaining separate models. We present GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion estimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to reformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the output motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging the synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global motion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce an estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with 2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity. Furthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed multimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals, offering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits: generative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like occlusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate GENMO's effectiveness as a generalist framework that successfully handles multiple human motion tasks within a single model. |

We explore, which of these models can consistently be embedded in a quantum theory of gravity and matter. We proceed by invoking a minimal number of degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model. Thus, we first investigate whether the Weinberg operator, a dimension-five-operator that generates neutrino masses without requiring degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model, can arise in asymptotically safe quantum gravity. We find a negative answer with far-reaching consequences: new degrees of freedom beyond gravity and the Standard Model are necessary to give neutrinos a mass in the asymptotic-safety paradigm. Second, we explore whether the type-I Seesaw mechanism is viable and discover an upper bound on the Seesaw scale. The bound depends on the mass of the visible neutrino. We find a numerical value of $10^{14}\, \rm GeV$ for this bound when neglecting neutrino mixing for a visible mass of $10^{-10}\, \rm GeV$. Conversely, for the most ``natural" value of the Seesaw scale in a quantum-gravity setting, which is the Planck scale, we predict an upper bound for the neutrino mass of the visible neutrino of approximately $10^{-15}\, \rm GeV$. Third, we explore whether neutrinos could also be Pseudo-Dirac-neutrinos in asymptotic safety and find that this possibility can be accommodated. |
| 2025-05-02 | [Evaluating Frontier Models for Stealth and Situational Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01420v1) | Mary Phuong, Roland S. Zimmermann et al. | Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of frontier AI models scheming -- knowingly and covertly pursuing an objective misaligned with its developer's intentions. Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present eleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We demonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability safety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost certainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We run our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show concerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth. |
| 2025-05-02 | [Propagation and circulating modes of reciprocal non-Hermitian skin effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01417v1) | Issei Takeda, Taiki Yoda et al. | The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a novel localization phenomenon, in which all bulk states in a non-Hermitian system under certain conditions are localized at the edge of the system. Conventionally, most studies of NHSE have dealt with discrete lattice systems with non-reciprocal couplings. However in recent years, NHSE in a reciprocal two-dimensional continuous medium, such as photonic crystal systems, has also been reported. In particular, we have previously shown that NHSE also occurs in two-dimensional uniform media. In such two-dimensional systems, skin modes propagate in a direction perpendicular to the localization direction, and especially, they have the property of propagating in only one direction. In this paper, we show numerically an intriguing scattering phenomenon: when a scatterer is placed in the path of a skin mode, the scattering causes the skin mode to hop between opposing edges. In addition, we propose a new method of generating circulating modes with orbital angular momentum using this scattering phenomenon. Our work paves the way for new applications of NHSE as micro-sized optical devices manipulating or generating OAM. |

Corsetti et al. | Spontaneously emitted photons are entangled with the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom of the emitting atom, so interference and measurement of these photons can entangle separate matter-based quantum systems as a resource for quantum information processing. However, the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission hinders the single-mode photonic operations required to generate entanglement. Current demonstrations rely on bulk photon-collection and manipulation optics that suffer from environment-induced phase instability, mode matching challenges, and system-to-system variability, factors that impede scaling to the large numbers of entangled pairs needed for quantum information processing. To address these limitations, we demonstrate a collection method that enables passive phase stability, straightforward photonic manipulation, and intrinsic reproducibility. Specifically, we engineer a waveguide-integrated grating to couple photons emitted from a trapped ion into a single optical mode within a microfabricated ion-trap chip. Using the integrated collection optic, we characterize the collection efficiency, image the ion, and detect the ion's quantum state. This proof-of-principle demonstration lays the foundation for leveraging the inherent stability and reproducibility of integrated photonics to efficiently create, manipulate, and measure multipartite quantum states in arrays of quantum emitters. |

However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

| 2025-05-01 | [Robotic Visual Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00693v1) | Yanbang Li, Ziyang Gong et al. | Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and Datasets in this paper will be released soon. |
| 2025-05-01 | [Towards Autonomous Micromobility through Scalable Urban Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00690v1) | Wayne Wu, Honglin He et al. | Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules: Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity, realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility. URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents: Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each robot's strengths and limitations. |

A central challenge in this area remains the establishment of theoretical guarantees for safety during both the learning and deployment processes. Given the successful implementation of Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based safety strategies in a range of control-affine robotic systems, CBF-based safe RL demonstrates significant promise for practical applications in real-world scenarios. However, integrating these two approaches presents several challenges. First, embedding safety optimization within the RL training pipeline requires that the optimization outputs be differentiable with respect to the input parameters, a condition commonly referred to as differentiable optimization, which is non-trivial to solve. Second, the differentiable optimization framework confronts significant efficiency issues, especially when dealing with multi-constraint problems. To address these challenges, this paper presents a CBF-based safe RL architecture that effectively mitigates the issues outlined above. The proposed approach constructs a continuous AND logic approximation for the multiple constraints using a single composite CBF. By leveraging this approximation, a close-form solution of the quadratic programming is derived for the policy network in RL, thereby circumventing the need for differentiable optimization within the end-to-end safe RL pipeline. This strategy significantly reduces computational complexity because of the closed-form solution while maintaining safety guarantees. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison to existing approaches relying on differentiable optimization, the proposed method significantly reduces training computational costs while ensuring provable safety throughout the training process. |

Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management. |

In this paper, we define IGV as a technology that combines generative capabilities to produce diverse high-quality video content with interactive features that enable user engagement through control signals and responsive feedback. We survey the current landscape of IGV applications, focusing on three major domains: 1) gaming, where IGV enables infinite exploration in virtual worlds; 2) embodied AI, where IGV serves as a physics-aware environment synthesizer for training agents in multimodal interaction with dynamically evolving scenes; and 3) autonomous driving, where IGV provides closed-loop simulation capabilities for safety-critical testing and validation. To guide future development, we propose a comprehensive framework that decomposes an ideal IGV system into five essential modules: Generation, Control, Memory, Dynamics, and Intelligence. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the technical challenges and future directions in realizing each component for an ideal IGV system, such as achieving real-time generation, enabling open-domain control, maintaining long-term coherence, simulating accurate physics, and integrating causal reasoning. We believe that this systematic analysis will facilitate future research and development in the field of IGV, ultimately advancing the technology toward more sophisticated and practical applications. |

This work proposes Spotlight, a low-overhead and unobtrusive system for protecting live speech videos from visual falsification of speaker identity and lip and facial motion. Unlike predominant falsification detection methods operating in the digital domain, Spotlight creates dynamic physical signatures at the event site and embeds them into all video recordings via imperceptible modulated light. These physical signatures encode semantically-meaningful features unique to the speech event, including the speaker's identity and facial motion, and are cryptographically-secured to prevent spoofing. The signatures can be extracted from any video downstream and validated against the portrayed speech content to check its integrity. Key elements of Spotlight include (1) a framework for generating extremely compact (i.e., 150-bit), pose-invariant speech video features, based on locality-sensitive hashing; and (2) an optical modulation scheme that embeds >200 bps into video while remaining imperceptible both in video and live. Prototype experiments on extensive video datasets show Spotlight achieves AUCs $\geq$ 0.99 and an overall true positive rate of 100% in detecting falsified videos. Further, Spotlight is highly robust across recording conditions, video post-processing techniques, and white-box adversarial attacks on its video feature extraction methodologies. |

Sreenivas et al. | Neural network-based policies have demonstrated success in many robotic applications, but often lack human-explanability, which poses challenges in safety-critical deployments. To address this, we propose a neuro-symbolic explanation framework that generates a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) specification to describe a robot policy in a interpretable form. Existing methods typically produce explanations that are verbose and inconsistent, which hinders explainability, and loose, which do not give meaningful insights into the underlying policy. We address these issues by introducing a simplification process consisting of predicate filtering, regularization, and iterative pruning. We also introduce three novel explainability evaluation metrics -- conciseness, consistency, and strictness -- to assess explanation quality beyond conventional classification metrics. Our method is validated in three simulated robotic environments, where it outperforms baselines in generating concise, consistent, and strict wSTL explanations without sacrificing classification accuracy. This work bridges policy learning with formal methods, contributing to safer and more transparent decision-making in robotics. |

Therefore, we present Water-DSLAM, a novel laser-aided multi-sensor fusion system that can achieve uninterrupted, fault-tolerant dense SLAM capable of continuous in-situ observation in diverse complex underwater scenarios through three key innovations: Firstly, we develop Water-Scanner, a multi-sensor fusion robotic platform featuring a self-designed Underwater Binocular Structured Light (UBSL) module that enables high-precision 3D perception. Secondly, we propose a fault-tolerant triple-subsystem architecture combining: 1) DP-INS (DVL- and Pressure-aided Inertial Navigation System): fusing inertial measurement unit, doppler velocity log, and pressure sensor based Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF) to provide high-frequency absolute odometry 2) Water-UBSL: a novel Iterated ESKF (IESKF)-based tight coupling between UBSL and DP-INS to mitigate UBSL's degeneration issues 3) Water-Stereo: a fusion of DP-INS and stereo camera for accurate initialization and tracking. Thirdly, we introduce a multi-modal factor graph back-end that dynamically fuses heterogeneous sensor data. The proposed multi-sensor factor graph maintenance strategy efficiently addresses issues caused by asynchronous sensor frequencies and partial data loss.

Ren, Zhihong Shao et al. | We introduce DeepSeek-Prover-V2, an open-source large language model designed for formal theorem proving in Lean 4, with initialization data collected through a recursive theorem proving pipeline powered by DeepSeek-V3. The cold-start training procedure begins by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to decompose complex problems into a series of subgoals. The proofs of resolved subgoals are synthesized into a chain-of-thought process, combined with DeepSeek-V3's step-by-step reasoning, to create an initial cold start for reinforcement learning. This process enables us to integrate both informal and formal mathematical reasoning into a unified model. The resulting model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving, reaching 88.9% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test and solving 49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench. In addition to standard benchmarks, we introduce ProverBench, a collection of 325 formalized problems, to enrich our evaluation, including 15 selected problems from the recent AIME competitions (years 24-25). Further evaluation on these 15 AIME problems shows that the model successfully solves 6 of them. In comparison, DeepSeek-V3 solves 8 of these problems using majority voting, highlighting that the gap between formal and informal mathematical reasoning in large language models is substantially narrowing. |
| 2025-04-29 | [Toward Efficient Exploration by Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997v1) | Dilip Arumugam, Thomas L. Griffiths | A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs). While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration. |

We propose to learn a 4D world model by training on RGB-DN (RGB, Depth, and Normal) videos. This not only surpasses traditional 2D models by incorporating detailed shape, configuration, and temporal changes into their predictions, but also allows us to effectively learn accurate inverse dynamic models for an embodied agent. Specifically, we first extend existing robotic manipulation video datasets with depth and normal information leveraging off-the-shelf models. Next, we fine-tune a video generation model on this annotated dataset, which jointly predicts RGB-DN (RGB, Depth, and Normal) for each frame. We then present an algorithm to directly convert generated RGB, Depth, and Normal videos into a high-quality 4D scene of the world. Our method ensures temporal and spatial coherence in 4D scene predictions from embodied scenarios, enables novel view synthesis for embodied environments, and facilitates policy learning that significantly outperforms those derived from prior video-based world models. |

In this work, we introduce XPG-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to efficiently perform MS tasks through explainable, priority-guided decision-making based on raw sensory inputs. XPG-RL integrates a task-driven action prioritization mechanism with a learned context-aware switching strategy that dynamically selects from a discrete set of action primitives such as target grasping, occlusion removal, and viewpoint adjustment. Within this strategy, a policy is optimized to output adaptive threshold values that govern the discrete selection among action primitives. The perception module fuses RGB-D inputs with semantic and geometric features to produce a structured scene representation for downstream decision-making. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that XPG-RL consistently outperforms baseline methods in task success rates and motion efficiency, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ higher efficiency in long-horizon tasks. These results underscore the benefits of integrating domain knowledge with learnable decision-making policies for robust and efficient robotic manipulation. |

Alghamdi, Shinkyu Park | We propose an opinion-driven navigation framework for multi-robot traversal through a narrow corridor. Our approach leverages a multi-agent decision-making model known as the Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (NOD) to address the narrow corridor passage problem, formulated as a multi-robot navigation game. By integrating the NOD model with a multi-robot path planning algorithm, we demonstrate that the framework effectively reduces the likelihood of deadlocks during corridor traversal. To ensure scalability with an increasing number of robots, we introduce a game reduction technique that enables efficient coordination in larger groups. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. |

Formal verification of these systems is challenging due to the size and complexity of the perception DNNs as well as hard-to-quantify, changing environment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic verification framework for autonomous systems based on the following key concepts: (1) Scenario-based Modeling: We decompose the task (e.g., car navigation) into a composition of scenarios, each representing a different environment condition. (2) Probabilistic Abstractions: For each scenario, we build a compact abstraction of perception based on the DNN's performance on an offline dataset that represents the scenario's environment condition. (3) Symbolic Reasoning and Acceleration: The abstractions enable efficient compositional verification of the autonomous system via symbolic reasoning and a novel acceleration proof rule that bounds the error probability of the system under arbitrary variations of environment conditions. We illustrate our approach on two case studies: an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs and a simulation model of an F1Tenth autonomous car using LiDAR observations. |

Because capturing images that avoid these pitfalls is challenging, this severely limits the wider use of SfM, especially by non-expert users. We overcome these limitations by augmenting the classical SfM paradigm with monocular depth and normal priors inferred by deep neural networks. Thanks to a tight integration of monocular and multi-view constraints, our approach significantly outperforms existing ones under extreme viewpoint changes, while maintaining strong performance in standard conditions. We also show that monocular priors can help reject faulty associations due to symmetries, which is a long-standing problem for SfM. This makes our approach the first capable of reliably reconstructing challenging indoor environments from few images. Through principled uncertainty propagation, it is robust to errors in the priors, can handle priors inferred by different models with little tuning, and will thus easily benefit from future progress in monocular depth and normal estimation.

However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner, and it remains underexplored whether the acquired 3D knowledge generalizes to unseen question types at any stage of the training. In this work we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that address 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between stages -- 3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and enable us to study the factual errors made by LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieve improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning. |
| 2025-04-28 | [Modular Machine Learning: An Indispensable Path towards New-Generation Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20020v1) | Xin Wang, Haoyang Li et al. | Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning, mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications. |

This work introduces an open-source implementation of the Physics-Informed Neural Network with Control (PINC) framework, designed to model the dynamics of an underwater vehicle. Using initial states, control actions, and time inputs, PINC extends PINNs to enable physically consistent transitions beyond the training domain. Various PINC configurations are tested, including differing loss functions, gradient-weighting schemes, and hyperparameters. Validation on a simulated underwater vehicle demonstrates more accurate long-horizon predictions compared to a non-physics-informed baseline |

Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...] |
| 2025-04-25 | [Generalization Capability for Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18538v1) | Yixiao Wang | Imitation learning holds the promise of equipping robots with versatile skills by learning from expert demonstrations. However, policies trained on finite datasets often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. In this work, we present a unified perspective on the generalization capability of imitation learning, grounded in both information theorey and data distribution property. We first show that the generalization gap can be upper bounded by (i) the conditional information bottleneck on intermediate representations and (ii) the mutual information between the model parameters and the training dataset. This characterization provides theoretical guidance for designing effective training strategies in imitation learning, particularly in determining whether to freeze, fine-tune, or train large pretrained encoders (e.g., vision-language models or vision foundation models) from scratch to achieve better generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high conditional entropy from input to output induces a flatter likelihood landscape, thereby reducing the upper bound on the generalization gap. In addition, it shortens the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) escape time from sharp local minima, which may increase the likelihood of reaching global optima under fixed optimization budgets. These insights explain why imitation learning often exhibits limited generalization and underscore the importance of not only scaling the diversity of input data but also enriching the variability of output labels conditioned on the same input. |

Event cameras can be used simply to decode the LED signals and also to localize the camera relative to the LED marker positions. However, there is no public dataset to benchmark the decoding and localization in various real-world settings. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first public dataset that consists of an event camera, a frame camera, and ground-truth poses that are precisely synchronized with hardware triggers. It provides various camera motions with various sensitivities in different scene brightness settings, both indoor and outdoor. Furthermore, we propose a novel method of localization that leverages the Contrast Maximization framework for motion estimation and compensation. The detailed analysis and experimental results demonstrate the advantages of LED-based localization with events over the conventional AR-marker--based one with frames, as well as the efficacy of the proposed method in localization. We hope that the proposed dataset serves as a future benchmark for both motion-related classical computer vision tasks and LED marker decoding tasks simultaneously, paving the way to broadening applications of event cameras on mobile devices. https://woven-visionai.github.io/evlc-dataset |

On the other hand, distributed learning may increase the risk of exposure to malicious attacks where attacks on a local model may spread to other models by parameter exchange. Meanwhile, such attacks can be hard to detect due to the dynamic wireless environment, especially considering local models can be heterogeneous with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the effect of malicious attacks and develop advanced defense techniques for FL-enabled wireless networks. In this work, we introduce a federated deep reinforcement learning-based cell sleep control scenario that enhances the energy efficiency of the network. We propose multiple intelligent attacks targeting the learning-based approach and we propose defense methods to mitigate such attacks. In particular, we have designed two attack models, generative adversarial network (GAN)-enhanced model poisoning attack and regularization-based model poisoning attack. As a counteraction, we have proposed two defense schemes, autoencoder-based defense, and knowledge distillation (KD)-enabled defense. The autoencoder-based defense method leverages an autoencoder to identify the malicious participants and only aggregate the parameters of benign local models during the global aggregation, while KD-based defense protects the model from attacks by controlling the knowledge transferred between the global model and local models. |
| 2025-04-25 | [Examining the Impact of Optical Aberrations to Image Classification and Object Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18510v1) | Patrick MÃ¼ller, Alexander Braun et al. | Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be successful in various computer vision applications such that models even infer in safety-critical situations. Therefore, vision models have to behave in a robust way to disturbances such as noise or blur. While seminal benchmarks exist to evaluate model robustness to diverse corruptions, blur is often approximated in an overly simplistic way to model defocus, while ignoring the different blur kernel shapes that result from optical systems. To study model robustness against realistic optical blur effects, this paper proposes two datasets of blur corruptions, which we denote OpticsBench and LensCorruptions. OpticsBench examines primary aberrations such as coma, defocus, and astigmatism, i.e. aberrations that can be represented by varying a single parameter of Zernike polynomials. To go beyond the principled but synthetic setting of primary aberrations, LensCorruptions samples linear combinations in the vector space spanned by Zernike polynomials, corresponding to 100 real lenses. Evaluations for image classification and object detection on ImageNet and MSCOCO show that for a variety of different pre-trained models, the performance on OpticsBench and LensCorruptions varies significantly, indicating the need to consider realistic image corruptions to evaluate a model's robustness against blur. |

However, designing such a sensor suite involves multiple critical design decisions, such as sensor selection, component placement, thermal and power limitations, compute requirements, networking, synchronization, and calibration. While the importance of these key aspects is widely recognized, they are often overlooked in academia or retained as proprietary knowledge within large corporations. To improve this situation, we present Boxi, a tightly integrated sensor payload that enables robust autonomy of robots in the wild. This paper discusses the impact of payload design decisions made to optimize algorithmic performance for downstream tasks, specifically focusing on state estimation and mapping. Boxi is equipped with a variety of sensors: two LiDARs, 10 RGB cameras including high-dynamic range, global shutter, and rolling shutter models, an RGB-D camera, 7 inertial measurement units (IMUs) of varying precision, and a dual antenna RTK GNSS system. Our analysis shows that time synchronization, calibration, and sensor modality have a crucial impact on the state estimation performance. We frame this analysis in the context of cost considerations and environment-specific challenges. We also present a mobile sensor suite `cookbook` to serve as a comprehensive guideline, highlighting generalizable key design considerations and lessons learned during the development of Boxi. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of Boxi being used in a variety of applications in real-world scenarios, contributing to robust autonomy.

The latest works addressing scene completion with diffusion models tackle this problem by reformulating the original DDPM as a local diffusion process. It contrasts with the common practice of operating at the level of objects, where vanilla DDPMs are currently used. In this work, we close the gap between these two lines of work. We identify approximations in the local diffusion formulation, show that they are not required to operate at the scene level, and that a vanilla DDPM with a well-chosen starting point is enough for completion. Finally, we demonstrate that our method, LiDPM, leads to better results in scene completion on SemanticKITTI. The project page is https://astra-vision.github.io/LiDPM . |

Existing approaches fall into two categories: keyframe-based strategies, which predict gripper poses in keyframes and execute them via motion planners, and continuous control methods, which estimate actions sequentially at each timestep. The keyframe-based method lacks inter-frame supervision, struggling to perform consistently or execute curved motions, while the continuous method suffers from weaker spatial perception. To address these issues, this paper introduces an end-to-end framework PPI (keyPose and Pointflow Interface), which integrates the prediction of target gripper poses and object pointflow with the continuous actions estimation. These interfaces enable the model to effectively attend to the target manipulation area, while the overall framework guides diverse and collision-free trajectories. By combining interface predictions with continuous actions estimation, PPI demonstrates superior performance in diverse bimanual manipulation tasks, providing enhanced spatial localization and satisfying flexibility in handling movement restrictions. In extensive evaluations, PPI significantly outperforms prior methods in both simulated and real-world experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a +16.1% improvement on the RLBench2 simulation benchmark and an average of +27.5% gain across four challenging real-world tasks. Notably, PPI exhibits strong stability, high precision, and remarkable generalization capabilities in real-world scenarios. Project page: https://yuyinyang3y.github.io/PPI/ |

By both symmetry analysis and microscopic methods we show that there is an additional term - a rotary invariant - in the superconducting free energy which allows for magnetoelectric effects even when the previously considered Lifshitz invariant vanishes. We show that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by manipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we suggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry techniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the superconducting correlations can form a texture. |

However, no existing work has harmonized learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this paper, we introduce \ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a physics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and 90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table tennis. Our project website: https://dreamstarring.github.io/HAMLET/. |

Velasco et al. | The pursuit of ever-shorter time scales is a frontier in modern physics, exemplified by the synthesis of attosecond light pulses -- an achievement made possible by coherently superimposing a broad range of photon energies, as required by the uncertainty principle. However, extending this progress into the zeptosecond regime poses significant challenges, as it demands phase-correlated optical spectra spanning hundreds of electronvolts. In this context, electrons offer a compelling alternative to light because they can be coherently manipulated to form broad energy superpositions, as demonstrated by the generation of attosecond pulses in ultrafast electron microscopes. Here, we propose a practical scheme for compressing free electrons into the zeptosecond domain by modulating their wave functions using suitably tailored broadband light fields. Building on recent advances in {free-electron--light--matter} interactions, our method introduces the concept of temporal lensing -- an extension of conventional optical lensing to the time domain -- to produce electron pulses with arbitrarily short durations. |
| 2025-04-23 | [Latent Diffusion Planning for Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16925v1) | Amber Xie, Oleh Rybkin et al. | Recent progress in imitation learning has been enabled by policy architectures that scale to complex visuomotor tasks, multimodal distributions, and large datasets. However, these methods often rely on learning from large amount of expert demonstrations. To address these shortcomings, we propose Latent Diffusion Planning (LDP), a modular approach consisting of a planner which can leverage action-free demonstrations, and an inverse dynamics model which can leverage suboptimal data, that both operate over a learned latent space. First, we learn a compact latent space through a variational autoencoder, enabling effective forecasting of future states in image-based domains. Then, we train a planner and an inverse dynamics model with diffusion objectives. By separating planning from action prediction, LDP can benefit from the denser supervision signals of suboptimal and action-free data. On simulated visual robotic manipulation tasks, LDP outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning approaches, as they cannot leverage such additional data. |

While dynamics models used in model-based control can be learned from real-world data, they often struggle to generalize to unseen terrain, making real-time adaptation essential. We propose a novel framework that combines a Kalman filter-based online adaptation scheme with meta-learned parameters to address these challenges. Offline meta-learning optimizes the basis functions along which adaptation occurs, as well as the adaptation parameters, while online adaptation dynamically adjusts the onboard dynamics model in real time for model-based control. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, including real-world testing on a full-scale autonomous off-road vehicle, demonstrating that our method outperforms baseline approaches in prediction accuracy, performance, and safety metrics, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. Our results underscore the effectiveness of meta-learned dynamics model adaptation, advancing the development of reliable autonomous systems capable of navigating diverse and unseen environments.

This work introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for visual servoing tasks on SCAs with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capabilities, demonstrated on a single section pneumatic manipulator capable of bending and twisting. The framework decouples kinematics from mechanical properties using an RL kinematic controller for motion planning and a local controller for actuation refinement, leveraging minimal sensing with visual feedback. Trained entirely in simulation, the RL controller achieved a 99.8% success rate. When deployed on hardware, it achieved a 67% success rate in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. This approach offers a scalable solution for SCAs in 3D visual servoing, with potential for further refinement and expanded applications. |

However, if the trained policy does not meet the specifications, or there is conservatism in the verification algorithm, establishing these guarantees may not be possible. Instead, this work proposes to perform verification throughout training to ultimately aim for policies whose properties can be evaluated throughout runtime with lightweight, relaxed verification algorithms. The approach is to use differentiable reachability analysis and incorporate new components into the loss function. Numerical experiments on a quadrotor model and unicycle model highlight the ability of this approach to lead to learned control policies that satisfy desired reach-avoid and invariance specifications. |

The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work, we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 159% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the Maj@N metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks, and highlight TTRL's potential for broader tasks and domains. GitHub: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL |

A key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently solve complex domains. However, LLM agents have been found to suffer from sub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap, the inability to effectively act on knowledge present in the model. In this work, we systematically study why LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we closely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by fine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales. Our experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Tic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making abilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing gap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as $\epsilon$-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and self-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for decision-making. |

In this work, we propose ForesightNav, a novel exploration strategy inspired by human imagination and reasoning. Our approach equips robotic agents with the capability to predict contextual information, such as occupancy and semantic details, for unexplored regions. These predictions enable the robot to efficiently select meaningful long-term navigation goals, significantly enhancing exploration in unseen environments. We validate our imagination-based approach using the Structured3D dataset, demonstrating accurate occupancy prediction and superior performance in anticipating unseen scene geometry. Our experiments show that the imagination module improves exploration efficiency in unseen environments, achieving a 100% completion rate for PointNav and an SPL of 67% for ObjectNav on the Structured3D Validation split. These contributions demonstrate the power of imagination-driven reasoning for autonomous systems to enhance generalizable and efficient exploration. |

This paper explores the implementation of SAR4SLPs (Socially Assistive Robots for Speech-Language Pathologists) to investigate aspects such as engagement, therapeutic strategy discipline, and consistent intervention support. We assessed the current application of technology to clinical and educational settings, especially with respect to how SLPs might use SAR in their therapeutic work. An asynchronous remote community (ARC) collaborated with a cohort of practicing SLPs to consider the feasibility, potential effectiveness, and anticipated challenges with implementing SARs in day-to-day interventions and as practice facilitators. We focus in particular on the expressive functionality of SARs, modeling a foundational strategy that SLPs employ across various intervention targets. This paper highlights clinician-driven insights and design implications for developing SARs that support specific treatment goals through collaborative and iterative design. |

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive results for end-to-end robot control, it remains an open question how far such models can generalize in the wild. We describe $\pi_{0.5}$, a new model based on $\pi_{0}$ that uses co-training on heterogeneous tasks to enable broad generalization. $\pi_{0.5}$\ uses data from multiple robots, high-level semantic prediction, web data, and other sources to enable broadly generalizable real-world robotic manipulation. Our system uses a combination of co-training and hybrid multi-modal examples that combine image observations, language commands, object detections, semantic subtask prediction, and low-level actions. Our experiments show that this kind of knowledge transfer is essential for effective generalization, and we demonstrate for the first time that an end-to-end learning-enabled robotic system can perform long-horizon and dexterous manipulation skills, such as cleaning a kitchen or bedroom, in entirely new homes. |

Yet current reasoning evaluations of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often rely on text descriptions and allow language-based reasoning shortcuts, failing to measure genuine vision-centric reasoning. To address this, we introduce VisuLogic: a benchmark of 1,000 human-verified problems across six categories (e.g., quantitative shifts, spatial relations, attribute comparisons). These various types of questions can be evaluated to assess the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs from multiple perspectives. We evaluate leading MLLMs on this benchmark and analyze their results to identify common failure modes. Most models score below 30% accuracy-only slightly above the 25% random baseline and far below the 51.4% achieved by humans-revealing significant gaps in visual reasoning. Furthermore, we provide a supplementary training dataset and a reinforcement-learning baseline to support further progress. |

While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence. To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness. We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view understanding. The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://danielchyeh.github.io/All-Angles-Bench/. |

In this paper, we present DRAWER, a novel framework that converts a video of a static indoor scene into a photorealistic and interactive digital environment. Our approach centers on two main contributions: (i) a reconstruction module based on a dual scene representation that reconstructs the scene with fine-grained geometric details, and (ii) an articulation module that identifies articulation types and hinge positions, reconstructs simulatable shapes and appearances and integrates them into the scene. The resulting virtual environment is photorealistic, interactive, and runs in real time, with compatibility for game engines and robotic simulation platforms. We demonstrate the potential of DRAWER by using it to automatically create an interactive game in Unreal Engine and to enable real-to-sim-to-real transfer for robotics applications. |

However, reward hacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward hacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future rewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this, we propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation of PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as the minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward hacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more reasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that PRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable reasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps. In contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even at the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with just 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce the best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments, achieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5 benchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and analyze the causes of training collapse. Code and models are available at https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE. |

Exoskeletons offer potential assistance but falter without accurate intent recognition across diverse locomotion modes. This paper presents a locomotion prediction agent leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with memory systems, aimed at improving exoskeleton assistance in such settings. Using multimodal inputs - spoken commands and visual data from smart glasses - the agent integrates a Perception Module, Short-Term Memory (STM), Long-Term Memory (LTM), and Refinement Module to predict locomotion modes effectively. Evaluation reveals a baseline weighted F1-score of 0.73 without memory, rising to 0.81 with STM, and reaching 0.90 with both STM and LTM, excelling with vague and safety-critical commands. Calibration metrics, including a Brier Score drop from 0.244 to 0.090 and ECE from 0.222 to 0.044, affirm improved reliability. This framework supports safer, high-level human-exoskeleton collaboration, with promise for adaptive assistive systems in dynamic industries. |
| 2025-04-18 | [Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837v1) | Yang Yue, Zhiqi Chen et al. | Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study, however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the pass@\textit{k} metric with large values of \textit{k} to explore the reasoning capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at smaller values of $k$ (\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$ values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models. Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards, therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model, different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

To address this asymmetry, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark. |

Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. Visuomotor policies enhanced by DiffOG generate smoother, constraint-compliant action trajectories in a more interpretable way. DiffOG exhibits strong generalization capabilities and high flexibility. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy. |

Due to the relative ease to collect, human demonstrations constitute a valuable addition when incorporated appropriately. However, existing methods utilizing human demonstrations face challenges in inferring precise actions, ameliorating embodiment gaps, and fusing with frontier generalist robot training pipelines. In this work, building on prior studies that demonstrate the viability of using hand-held grippers for efficient data collection, we leverage the user's control over the gripper's appearance--specifically by assigning it a unique, easily segmentable color--to enable simple and reliable application of the RANSAC and ICP registration method for precise end-effector pose estimation. We show in simulation that precisely labeled human demonstrations on their own allow policies to reach on average 88.1% of the performance of using robot demonstrations, and boost policy performance when combined with robot demonstrations, despite the inherent embodiment gap. |

The approach applies to both hydraulic and pneumatic actuation systems. A Jacobian-based formulation maps actuator inputs to joint and task-space responses. Hydraulic actuators are modeled under incompressible assumptions, while pneumatic actuators are described using nonlinear pressure-volume relations. The framework enables consistent evaluation of manipulability ellipsoids and compliance matrices across actuation modes. We validate the analysis using two representative hands: DexCo (hydraulic) and Edgy-2 (pneumatic). Results highlight actuation-dependent trade-offs in dexterity and passive stiffness. These findings provide insights for structure-aware design and actuator selection in soft-rigid robotic fingers. |

While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose. |

Existing approaches address these issues by augmenting image observations in RGB space or employing Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipelines based on physical simulators. However, the former is constrained to 2D data augmentation, while the latter suffers from imprecise physical simulation caused by inaccurate geometric reconstruction. This paper introduces RoboSplat, a novel method that generates diverse, visually realistic demonstrations by directly manipulating 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we reconstruct the scene through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), directly edit the reconstructed scene, and augment data across six types of generalization with five techniques: 3D Gaussian replacement for varying object types, scene appearance, and robot embodiments; equivariant transformations for different object poses; visual attribute editing for various lighting conditions; novel view synthesis for new camera perspectives; and 3D content generation for diverse object types. Comprehensive real-world experiments demonstrate that RoboSplat significantly enhances the generalization of visuomotor policies under diverse disturbances. Notably, while policies trained on hundreds of real-world demonstrations with additional 2D data augmentation achieve an average success rate of 57.2%, RoboSplat attains 87.8% in one-shot settings across six types of generalization in the real world. |

These problems are inherently nonconvex, since the system dynamics involves bilinear products between the discretization time step and the system state and controls. The proposed relaxation is closely related to the standard second-order semidefinite relaxation for quadratic constraints, but we carefully select a subset of the possible bilinear terms and apply a change of variables to achieve empirically tight relaxations while keeping the computational load light. We further extend our method to handle piecewise-affine (PWA) systems by formulating the PWA optimal-control problem as a shortest-path problem in a graph of convex sets (GCS). In this GCS, different paths represent different mode sequences for the PWA system, and the convex sets model the relaxed dynamics within each mode. By combining a tight convex relaxation of the GCS problem with our semidefinite relaxation with time scaling, we can solve PWA optimal-control problems through a single semidefinite program. |

Existing hallucination mitigation methods typically follow one of two paradigms: generation adjustment, which modifies decoding behavior to align text with visual inputs, and post-hoc verification, where external models assess and correct outputs. While effective, generation adjustment methods often rely on heuristics and lack correction mechanisms, while post-hoc verification is complicated, typically requiring multiple models and tending to reject outputs rather than refine them. In this work, we introduce REVERSE, a unified framework that integrates hallucination-aware training with on-the-fly self-verification. By leveraging a new hallucination-verification dataset containing over 1.3M semi-synthetic samples, along with a novel inference-time retrospective resampling technique, our approach enables VLMs to both detect hallucinations during generation and dynamically revise those hallucinations. Our evaluations show that REVERSE achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction, outperforming the best existing methods by up to 12% on CHAIR-MSCOCO and 28% on HaloQuest. Our dataset, model, and code are available at: https://reverse-vlm.github.io. |

Existing control methods impose compromises on hand designs and applications. However, learning-based approaches present opportunities to rethink these trade-offs, particularly to address challenges with tendon-driven actuation and low-cost materials. This work presents RUKA, a tendon-driven humanoid hand that is compact, affordable, and capable. Made from 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components, RUKA has 5 fingers with 15 underactuated degrees of freedom enabling diverse human-like grasps. Its tendon-driven actuation allows powerful grasping in a compact, human-sized form factor. To address control challenges, we learn joint-to-actuator and fingertip-to-actuator models from motion-capture data collected by the MANUS glove, leveraging the hand's morphological accuracy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate RUKA's superior reachability, durability, and strength compared to other robotic hands. Teleoperation tasks further showcase RUKA's dexterous movements. The open-source design and assembly instructions of RUKA, code, and data are available at https://ruka-hand.github.io/. |

In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting. |

It is the building block for many error-correcting schemes and matches the first three moments of the Haar measure over the unitary group -a property that is essential for a broad range of quantum algorithms, with applications in pseudorandomness, learning theory, benchmarking, and entanglement distillation. At the heart of understanding many properties of the Clifford group lies the Clifford commutant: the set of operators that commute with $k$-fold tensor powers of Clifford unitaries. Previous understanding of this commutant has been limited to relatively small values of $k$, constrained by the number of qubits $n$. In this work, we develop a complete theory of the Clifford commutant. Our first result provides an explicit orthogonal basis for the commutant and computes its dimension for arbitrary $n$ and $k$. We also introduce an alternative and easy-to-manipulate basis formed by isotropic sums of Pauli operators. We show that this basis is generated by products of permutations -which generate the unitary group commutant- and at most three other operators. Additionally, we develop a graphical calculus allowing a diagrammatic manipulation of elements of this basis. These results enable a wealth of applications: among others, we characterize all measurable magic measures and identify optimal strategies for stabilizer property testing, whose success probability also offers an operational interpretation to stabilizer entropies. Finally, we show that these results also generalize to multi-qudit systems with prime local dimension. |

However, developing high-performance ASR models remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, due to the scarcity of large, labeled speech datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to produce. In this work, we employ weakly supervised learning to train an Arabic ASR model using the Conformer architecture. Our model is trained from scratch on 15,000 hours of weakly annotated speech data covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal Arabic (DA), eliminating the need for costly manual transcriptions. Despite the absence of human-verified labels, our approach attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, exceeding all previous efforts in the field of Arabic ASR on the standard benchmarks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision as a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to traditional supervised approaches, paving the way for improved ASR systems in low resource settings. |

In the antiferromagnetic case, the GS density manifests various patterns of distributions, including facial-makeup states, petal states, topological fissure states, multiple-half-ring states and property-distinguished vertical and horizonal stripe states. We notice a peculiar phenomenon of density-phase separation in the sense that the variations of density and phase tend to be independent. In ferromagnetic case, the GS exhibits a semi-circular or half-disk status of density embedded with vortices and anti-vortices. The spin distribution can self-arrange into an array of half-skyrmions and we also find a half-antiskyrmion fence separating vortex-antivortex pairs. Our study indicates that one can manipulate the emergence of exotic quantum states via the interplay of the SOC, interaction and potential geometry and the abundant state variations might also provide potential resources for quantum metrology. |

We generalise bisimulation learning to systems with bounded branching and extend its applicability to model checking branching-time temporal logic, while previously it was limited to deterministic systems and model checking linear-time properties. Our method computes a finite stutter-insensitive bisimulation quotient of the system under analysis, represented as a decision tree. We adapt the proof rule for well-founded bisimulations to an iterative procedure that trains candidate decision trees from sample transitions of the system, and checks their validity over the entire transition relation using SMT solving. This results in a new technology for model checking CTL* without the next-time operator. Our technique is sound, entirely automated, and yields abstractions that are succinct and effective for formal verification and system diagnostics. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on diverse benchmarks comprising concurrent software, communication protocols and robotic scenarios. Our method performs comparably to mature tools in the special case of LTL model checking, and outperforms the state of the art in CTL and CTL* model checking for systems with very large and countably infinite state space. |

While reinforcement learning (RL) applied to LLMs shows promise, progress is significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale training data that is sufficiently challenging, possesses verifiable answer formats suitable for RL, and is free from contamination with evaluation benchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new, large-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems, specifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K is curated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent decontamination against numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty (primarily Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding existing open resources in challenge. Each problem includes a verifiable final answer, enabling rule-based RL, and three distinct R1-generated solutions suitable for diverse training paradigms like supervised fine-tuning or distillation. Spanning a wide range of mathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the development of generalizable reasoning. We demonstrate that models trained on DeepMath-103K achieve significant improvements on challenging mathematical benchmarks, validating its effectiveness. We release DeepMath-103K publicly to facilitate community progress in building more capable AI reasoning systems: https://github.com/zwhe99/DeepMath. |
| 2025-04-15 | [A Clean Slate for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11453v1) | Matthew Thomas Jackson, Uljad Berdica et al. | Progress in offline reinforcement learning (RL) has been impeded by ambiguous problem definitions and entangled algorithmic designs, resulting in inconsistent implementations, insufficient ablations, and unfair evaluations. Although offline RL explicitly avoids environment interaction, prior methods frequently employ extensive, undocumented online evaluation for hyperparameter tuning, complicating method comparisons. Moreover, existing reference implementations differ significantly in boilerplate code, obscuring their core algorithmic contributions. We address these challenges by first introducing a rigorous taxonomy and a transparent evaluation protocol that explicitly quantifies online tuning budgets. To resolve opaque algorithmic design, we provide clean, minimalistic, single-file implementations of various model-free and model-based offline RL methods, significantly enhancing clarity and achieving substantial speed-ups. Leveraging these streamlined implementations, we propose Unifloral, a unified algorithm that encapsulates diverse prior approaches within a single, comprehensive hyperparameter space, enabling algorithm development in a shared hyperparameter space. Using Unifloral with our rigorous evaluation protocol, we develop two novel algorithms - TD3-AWR (model-free) and MoBRAC (model-based) - which substantially outperform established baselines. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/EmptyJackson/unifloral. |

To counter this, we propose an adaptive real-time monitoring mechanism that detects abnormal thermal patterns in chip tiles. Our design space exploration helped identify key thermal features for an efficient anomaly detection module to be implemented at routers of network-enabled MPSoCs. To minimize hardware overhead, we employ weighted moving average (WMA) calculations and bit-shift operations, ensuring a lightweight yet effective implementation. By defining a spectrum of abnormal behaviors, our system successfully detects and mitigates malicious temperature fluctuations, reducing severe cases from 3.00{\deg}C to 1.9{\deg}C. The anomaly detection module achieves up to 82% of accuracy in detecting thermal attacks, which is only 10-15% less than top-performing machine learning (ML) models like Random Forest. However, our approach reduces hardware usage by up to 75% for logic resources and 100% for specialized resources, making it significantly more efficient than ML-based solutions. This method provides a practical, low-cost solution for resource-constrained environments, ensuring resilience against thermal attacks while maintaining system performance. |

Traditional models often rely on passive observation, but embodied cognition theory suggests that deeper understanding emerges from active interaction with the environment. This study investigates whether neural networks can autonomously internalize spatial concepts through interaction, focusing on planar navigation tasks. Using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) combined with Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), we show that agents can learn to encode spatial properties like direction, distance, and obstacle avoidance. We introduce Hybrid Dynamical Systems (HDS) to model the agent-environment interaction as a closed dynamical system, revealing stable limit cycles that correspond to optimal navigation strategies. Ridge Representation allows us to map navigation paths into a fixed-dimensional behavioral space, enabling comparison with neural states. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) confirms strong alignment between these representations, suggesting that the agent's neural states actively encode spatial knowledge. Intervention experiments further show that specific neural dimensions are causally linked to navigation performance. This work provides an approach to bridging the gap between action and perception in AI, offering new insights into building adaptive, interpretable models that can generalize across complex environments. The causal validation of neural representations also opens new avenues for understanding and controlling the internal mechanisms of AI systems, pushing the boundaries of how machines learn and reason in dynamic, real-world scenarios. |

While various numerical methods have been developed to simulate these behaviors, many conventional approaches struggle to simultaneously capture geometric and material nonlinearities, as well as nonlinear external interactions, particularly in highly deformable and dynamically evolving systems. The Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) method has emerged as a robust and efficient numerical framework that intrinsically preserves geometric properties, accommodates material nonlinearity, and accurately models interactions with external environments and fields. By directly discretizing geometric and mechanical quantities, DDG provides an accurate, stable, and efficient approach to modeling flexible structures, addressing key limitations of traditional numerical methods. This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to the DDG method for simulating nonlinear behaviors in flexible structures. It covers DDG theory, simulation frameworks, and MATLAB implementation, with examples spanning dynamic systems, geometric and material nonlinearities, and external interactions like magnetics and fluids, culminating in practical insights and future directions. By offering a comprehensive and practical guide, together with open-source MATLAB code, this tutorial aims to facilitate the broader adoption of DDG-based numerical tools among researchers and engineers in computational mechanics, applied mathematics, and structural design. |

Prior works formulate the traffic layout generation as predictive progress, either by denoising entire sequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame. However, full sequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted next-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance. Further, the learned model struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large number of safe and ordinal driving behaviors from open datasets. To overcome these, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves reactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging scenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states. At the core of the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking training strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental updates throughout the denoising process. To complement challenging scenario generation, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases. It covers 540 hours of simulated data, including high-risk interactions such as cut-in, sudden braking, and collision. Nexus achieves superior generation realism while preserving reactivity and goal orientation, with a 40% reduction in displacement error. We further demonstrate that Nexus improves closed-loop planning by 20% through data augmentation and showcase its capability in safety-critical data generation. |

Notably, the Pass@1 rate reliably improves during supervised finetuning (SFT), but Pass@k rapidly deteriorates. Surprisingly, a simple intervention of interpolating the weights of the latest SFT checkpoint with an early checkpoint, otherwise known as WiSE-FT, almost completely recovers Pass@k while also improving Pass@1. The WiSE-FT variant achieves better test-time scaling (Best@k, majority vote) and achieves superior results with less data when tuned further by reinforcement learning. Finally, we find that WiSE-FT provides complementary performance gains that cannot be achieved only through diversity-inducing decoding strategies, like temperature scaling. We formalize a bias-variance tradeoff of Pass@k with respect to the expectation and variance of Pass@1 over the test distribution. We find that WiSE-FT can reduce bias and variance simultaneously, while temperature scaling inherently trades-off between bias and variance. |

However, it is challenging to determine how to optimally adjust reconfigurable parameters for a given task, especially when the controller depends on the robot's configuration. In this paper, we address this problem using a tendon-driven reconfigurable manipulator composed of multiple serially connected origami-inspired modules as an example. Under tendon actuation, these modules can achieve different shapes and motions, governed by joint stiffnesses (reconfiguration parameters) and the tendon displacements (control inputs). We leverage recent advances in co-optimization of design and control for robotic system to treat reconfiguration parameters as design variables and optimize them using reinforcement learning techniques. We first establish a forward model based on the minimum potential energy method to predict the shape of the manipulator under tendon actuations. Using the forward model as the environment dynamics, we then co-optimize the control policy (on the tendon displacements) and joint stiffnesses of the modules for goal reaching tasks while ensuring collision avoidance. Through co-optimization, we obtain optimized joint stiffness and the corresponding optimal control policy to enable the manipulator to accomplish the task that would be infeasible with fixed reconfiguration parameters (i.e., fixed joint stiffness). We envision the co-optimization framework can be extended to other reconfigurable robotic systems, enabling them to optimally adapt their configuration and behavior for diverse tasks and environments. |

| 2025-04-14 | [Anchor Token Matching: Implicit Structure Locking for Training-free AR Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10434v1) | Taihang Hu, Linxuan Li et al. | Text-to-image generation has seen groundbreaking advancements with diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity synthesis and precise image editing through cross-attention manipulation. Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have re-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match diffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion models fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences in structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of attention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image editing, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we introduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing strategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention manipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by dynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the Anchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural consistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing while maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional training and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our findings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing, further bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive generative models. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/hutaiHang/ATM |

Traditional wrists struggle to balance these demands, often relying on complex control schemes or complicated mechanical designs to mitigate potential damage from force overload. In response, we present BiFlex, a flexible robotic wrist that uses a soft buckling honeycomb structure to provides a natural bimodal stiffness response. The higher stiffness mode enables precise household object manipulation, while the lower stiffness mode provides the compliance needed to adapt to external forces. We design BiFlex to maintain a fingertip deflection of less than 1 cm while supporting loads up to 500g and create a BiFlex wrist for many grippers, including Panda, Robotiq, and BaRiFlex. We validate BiFlex under several real-world experimental evaluations, including surface wiping, precise pick-and-place, and grasping under environmental constraints. We demonstrate that BiFlex simplifies control while maintaining precise object manipulation and enhanced safety in real-world applications. |

While Offline Reinforcement Learning enables the training of autonomous vehicles using such data, most available datasets lack meaningful reward labels. Reward labeling is essential as it provides feedback for the learning algorithm to distinguish between desirable and undesirable behaviors, thereby improving policy performance. This paper presents a novel pipeline for generating human-aligned reward labels. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of absent reward signals in real-world datasets by generating labels that reflect human judgment and safety considerations. The pipeline incorporates an adaptive safety component, activated by analyzing semantic segmentation maps, allowing the autonomous vehicle to prioritize safety over efficiency in potential collision scenarios. The proposed pipeline is applied to an occluded pedestrian crossing scenario with varying levels of pedestrian traffic, using synthetic and simulation data. The results indicate that the generated reward labels closely match the simulation reward labels. When used to train the driving policy using Behavior Proximal Policy Optimisation, the results are competitive with other baselines. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in producing reliable and human-aligned reward signals, facilitating the training of autonomous driving systems through Reinforcement Learning outside of simulation environments and in alignment with human values. |

Instead, a vanishing magnetization is often measured in a family of lanthanide complexes known as Single Molecule Toroics. The anomaly can be explained in terms of degenerate quantum states in which electron spins and orbital currents give rise to time-odd and space-odd magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments, carrying a vanishing magnetic dipole. Resilient to stray magnetic fields and susceptible to electric manipulation, toroidal moments are sparking growing interest for applications in spintronics, magnonics, and photonics. While macroscopic toroidal moments have been observed in extended systems such as bulk low-dimensional non-collinear ferromagnets, theoretically predicted quantum toroidal states in molecules are yet to be observed, as it is currently unclear how to split degenerate states carrying counter-rotating vortices via existing experimental setups. Here we propose a realistic experimental protocol to polarize and observe molecular toroidal moments using pulsed microwave radiation. Modelling the spin-dynamics in a pulsed MW-field, we find that three resonant MW-pulses, delivered either sequentially or simultaneously, to a class of MDy$_6$ (M = Al$^{3+}$, Cr$^{3+}$) molecules consisting of coupled Dy$_3$ toroidal moieties, can selectively and coherently transfer population to a long-lived polarized toroidal state. The ensuing magneto-electric properties can then be used as a read-out mechanism. Our results provide a strategy to measure and coherently manipulate toroidal states in molecular systems, which is expected to trigger applications of molecular toroidal states to quantum technologies. |

In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties. |

While promising, our initial experiments reveal that incorporating a thinking process through RL does not consistently lead to performance gains across all visual perception tasks. This leads us to delve into the essential role of RL in the context of visual perception. In this work, we return to the fundamentals and explore the effects of RL on different perception tasks. We observe that the perceptual complexity is a major factor in determining the effectiveness of RL. We also observe that reward design plays a crucial role in further approching the upper limit of model perception. To leverage these findings, we propose Perception-R1, a scalable RL framework using GRPO during MLLM post-training. With a standard Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, Perception-R1 achieves +4.2% on RefCOCO+, +17.9% on PixMo-Count, +4.2% on PageOCR, and notably, 31.9% AP on COCO2017 val for the first time, establishing a strong baseline for perception policy learning. |

Following the success of frontier reasoning models, recent work has demonstrated that RL fine-tuning consistently improves performance, even in smaller-scale models; however, the underlying mechanisms driving these improvements are not well-understood. Understanding the effects of RL fine-tuning requires disentangling its interaction with pretraining data composition, hyperparameters, and model scale, but such problems are exacerbated by the lack of transparency regarding the training data used in many existing models. In this work, we present a systematic end-to-end study of RL fine-tuning for mathematical reasoning by training models entirely from scratch on different mixtures of fully open datasets. We investigate the effects of various RL fine-tuning algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and Expert Iteration) across models of different scales. Our study reveals that RL algorithms consistently converge towards a dominant output distribution, amplifying patterns in the pretraining data. We also find that models of different scales trained on the same data mixture will converge to distinct output distributions, suggesting that there are scale-dependent biases in model generalization. Moreover, we find that RL post-training on simpler questions can lead to performance gains on harder ones, indicating that certain reasoning capabilities generalize across tasks. Our findings show that small-scale proxies in controlled settings can elicit interesting insights regarding the role of RL in shaping language model behavior. |
| 2025-04-10 | [Fast Adaptation with Behavioral Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07896v1) | Harshit Sikchi, Andrea Tirinzoni et al. | Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents to solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning. This is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside corresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure to directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any given reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often suboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the embedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising fast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a few steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any performance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that existing BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than those identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast adaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and actor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional task-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance of its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach mitigates the initial "unlearning" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning pre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of four state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and locomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over their zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing baselines. |

Alqarni, Danielle Pizzey et al. | In this study, we investigate the effect of buffer gas and magnetic field on the spectral line shapes of the potassium D1 transition using sealed vapour cells filled with varying amounts of neon as a buffer gas. Employing a dual-temperature control system, we independently manipulate the cell body and stem temperatures to explore Doppler and collisional effects on the spectrum. Our results show how the Voigt spectral profile changes from Gaussian- to Lorentzian-dominated forms due to pressure broadening and shifts caused by collisions between potassium atoms and neon. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with the literature values for potassium-neon collisions. For the first time we were able to incorporate the buffer-gas shift and broadening into the modified Voigt profile via the ElecSus code, and found excellent agreement between the predicted and measured line profiles. We also analyse the potassium D1 spectral lines in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime using strong magnetic fields, demonstrating how Zeeman splitting modifies the pressure-broadened line shape. This work provides valuable insights into collision-induced broadening and shifts, enhancing our understanding of potassium spectroscopy and its application in the development of advanced magneto-optical filters for solar physics and other applications. |

Existing methods typically rely on low-rank, parameter-efficient updates that limit the model's expressivity and introduce additional parameters per task, leading to scalability issues. To address these limitations, we propose a novel continual full fine-tuning approach leveraging adaptive singular value decomposition (SVD). Our method dynamically identifies task-specific low-rank parameter subspaces and constrains updates to be orthogonal to critical directions associated with prior tasks, thus effectively minimizing interference without additional parameter overhead or storing previous task gradients. We evaluate our approach extensively on standard continual learning benchmarks using both encoder-decoder (T5-Large) and decoder-only (LLaMA-2 7B) models, spanning diverse tasks including classification, generation, and reasoning. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, up to 7% higher average accuracy than recent baselines like O-LoRA, and notably maintains the model's general linguistic capabilities, instruction-following accuracy, and safety throughout the continual learning process by reducing forgetting to near-negligible levels. Our adaptive SVD framework effectively balances model plasticity and knowledge retention, providing a practical, theoretically grounded, and computationally scalable solution for continual learning scenarios in large language models. |

A motion dynamic model is essential for efficient skill acquisition and effective planning. In this work, we introduce the neural motion simulator (MoSim), a world model that predicts the future physical state of an embodied system based on current observations and actions. MoSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in physical state prediction and provides competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. This works shows that when a world model is accurate enough and performs precise long-horizon predictions, it can facilitate efficient skill acquisition in imagined worlds and even enable zero-shot reinforcement learning. Furthermore, MoSim can transform any model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm into a model-based approach, effectively decoupling physical environment modeling from RL algorithm development. This separation allows for independent advancements in RL algorithms and world modeling, significantly improving sample efficiency and enhancing generalization capabilities.

We propose FlashDepth, a method that satisfies all three requirements, performing depth estimation on a 2044x1148 streaming video at 24 FPS. We show that, with careful modifications to pretrained single-image depth models, these capabilities are enabled with relatively little data and training. We evaluate our approach across multiple unseen datasets against state-of-the-art depth models, and find that ours outperforms them in terms of boundary sharpness and speed by a significant margin, while maintaining competitive accuracy. We hope our model will enable various applications that require high-resolution depth, such as video editing, and online decision-making, such as robotics. |

Assistance games resolve key drawbacks of RLHF, such as incentives for deceptive behavior, by explicitly modeling the interaction between assistant and user as a two-player game where the assistant cannot observe their shared goal. Despite their potential, assistance games have only been explored in simple settings. Scaling them to more complex environments is difficult because it requires both solving intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty and accurately modeling human users' behavior. We present the first scalable approach to solving assistance games and apply it to a new, challenging Minecraft-based assistance game with over $10^{400}$ possible goals. Our approach, AssistanceZero, extends AlphaZero with a neural network that predicts human actions and rewards, enabling it to plan under uncertainty. We show that AssistanceZero outperforms model-free RL algorithms and imitation learning in the Minecraft-based assistance game. In a human study, our AssistanceZero-trained assistant significantly reduces the number of actions participants take to complete building tasks in Minecraft. Our results suggest that assistance games are a tractable framework for training effective AI assistants in complex environments. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/minecraft-building-assistance-game. |

However, this progress often outpaces methodological rigor, with many evaluations relying on benchmarking practices that lack transparency, robustness, or statistical grounding. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study and find that current mathematical reasoning benchmarks are highly sensitive to subtle implementation choices - including decoding parameters, random seeds, prompt formatting, and even hardware and software-framework configurations. Performance gains reported in recent studies frequently hinge on unclear comparisons or unreported sources of variance. To address these issues, we propose a standardized evaluation framework with clearly defined best practices and reporting standards. Using this framework, we reassess recent methods and find that reinforcement learning (RL) approaches yield only modest improvements - far below prior claims - and are prone to overfitting, especially on small-scale benchmarks like AIME24. In contrast, supervised finetuning (SFT) methods show consistently stronger generalization. To foster reproducibility, we release all code, prompts, and model outputs, for reasoning benchmarks, establishing more rigorous foundations for future work. |

However, selecting the most appropriate underwater robotic simulator (URS) remains a challenge due to wide variations in fidelity, extensibility, and task suitability. This paper presents a comprehensive review and comparative analysis of five state-of-the-art, ROS-compatible, open-source URSs: Stonefish, DAVE, HoloOcean, MARUS, and UNav-Sim. Each simulator is evaluated across multiple criteria including sensor fidelity, environmental realism, sim-to-real capabilities, and research impact. We evaluate them across architectural design, sensor and physics modeling, task capabilities, and research impact. Additionally, we discuss ongoing challenges in sim-to-real transfer and highlight the need for standardization and benchmarking in the field. Our findings aim to guide practitioners in selecting effective simulation environments and inform future development of more robust and transferable URSs. |

A critical challenge arises when the relative degree of the CBF varies across the state space. This variability can create regions within the safe set where the control input becomes unconstrained. When implemented as a safety filter, this may result in chattering near the safety boundary and ultimately compromise system safety. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for CBF synthesis by formulating it as solving a set of boundary value problems. The solutions to the boundary value problems are determined using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our approach ensures that the synthesized CBFs maintain a constant relative degree across the set of admissible states, thereby preventing unconstrained control scenarios. We illustrate the approach in simulation and further verify it through real-world quadrotor experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving desired system safety properties. |

Both approaches have recently demonstrated promising performance in controlling Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. However, selecting appropriate lifting functions for the Koopman operator in KMPC is challenging, while the data-driven representation from Willems' fundamental lemma in DeePC must be updated to approximate the local linearization when the equilibrium traffic state changes. In this paper, we propose a dictionary-free Koopman model predictive control (DF-KMPC) for CAV control. In particular, we first introduce a behavioral perspective to identify the optimal dictionary-free Koopman linear model. We then utilize an iterative algorithm to compute a data-driven approximation of the dictionary-free Koopman representation. Integrating this data-driven linear representation with predictive control leads to our DF-KMPC, which eliminates the need to select lifting functions and update the traffic equilibrium state. Nonlinear traffic simulations show that DF-KMPC effectively mitigates traffic waves and improves tracking performance. |

RodrÃ­guez Lera, Raquel FernÃ¡ndez HernÃ¡ndez et al. | This paper presents a novel framework for accessible and pedagogically-grounded robot explainability, designed to support human-robot interaction (HRI) with users who have diverse cognitive, communicative, or learning needs. We combine principles from Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Universal Design (UD) with symbolic communication strategies to facilitate the alignment of mental models between humans and robots. Our approach employs Asterics Grid and ARASAAC pictograms as a multimodal, interpretable front-end, integrated with a lightweight HTTP-to-ROS 2 bridge that enables real-time interaction and explanation triggering. We emphasize that explainability is not a one-way function but a bidirectional process, where human understanding and robot transparency must co-evolve. We further argue that in educational or assistive contexts, the role of a human mediator (e.g., a teacher) may be essential to support shared understanding. We validate our framework with examples of multimodal explanation boards and discuss how it can be extended to different scenarios in education, assistive robotics, and inclusive AI. |

Economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) schemes are widely used to optimize operation of energy hubs by efficiently dispatching resources and minimizing costs while ensuring operational constraints are met. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among hubs enhances network efficiency and reduces costs but also increases computational and privacy challenges, especially as the network scales. Additionally, current distributed control techniques require global recomputation whenever the network topology changes, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a clustering-based P2P trading framework that enables plug-and-play operation, allowing energy hubs to seamlessly join or leave without requiring network-wide controller updates. The impact is restricted to the hubs within the affected cluster. The energy trading problem is formulated as a bi-level bargaining game, where inter-cluster trading commitments are determined at the cluster level, while energy dispatch and cost-sharing among hubs within a cluster are refined at the hub level. Both levels are solved in a distributed manner using ADMM, ensuring computational feasibility and privacy preservation. Moreover, we develop plug-and-play procedures to handle dynamic topology changes at both the hub and cluster levels, minimizing disruptions across the network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bi-level framework reduces operational costs, and enables scalable energy management under plug-and-play operation. |

However, bioengineered strategies incorporating biophysical stimulation have emerged as promising alternatives. Electroactive materials facilitate the provision of controlled electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical stimuli, which support cell proliferation and tissue remodelling. Despite their ability to supply external electrical and mechanical stimuli to the tissue microenvironment, the electroactive polymers in use today often lack critical biochemical signals essential for native-like cell-cell and cell-scaffold interactions, thereby constraining their regenerative capabilities. To address the demand for biomimetic materials that possess enhanced capabilities in promoting cell and tissue stimulation, we present the development of a novel class of polymers called ionomeric extracellular matrices (iECMs). By utilising the linker-mediated conjugation of sulfonic acid biomolecules (taurine) to the backbone of an extracellular matrix protein (collagen), we illustrate the potential of iECMs as the first electromechanical actuating material platform derived entirely from ECM materials, paving the way for dynamic and soft-robotic platforms for a wide range of tissue engineering applications. |

Using Causal Attribution to Mitigate Reward Hacking in Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05294v1) | Pedro Ferreira, Wilker Aziz et al. | Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans. We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in "reward hacking" by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations. |
| 2025-04-07 | [Using Physiological Measures, Gaze, and Facial Expressions to Model Human Trust in a Robot Partner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05291v1) | Haley N. Green, Tariq Iqbal | With robots becoming increasingly prevalent in various domains, it has become crucial to equip them with tools to achieve greater fluency in interactions with humans. One of the promising areas for further exploration lies in human trust. A real-time, objective model of human trust could be used to maximize productivity, preserve safety, and mitigate failure. In this work, we attempt to use physiological measures, gaze, and facial expressions to model human trust in a robot partner. We are the first to design an in-person, human-robot supervisory interaction study to create a dedicated trust dataset. Using this dataset, we train machine learning algorithms to identify the objective measures that are most indicative of trust in a robot partner, advancing trust prediction in human-robot interactions. Our findings indicate that a combination of sensor modalities (blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and gaze) can enhance the accuracy of detecting human trust in a robot partner. Furthermore, the Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Decision Trees classifiers exhibit consistently better performance in measuring the person's trust in the robot partner. These results lay the groundwork for constructing a real-time trust model for human-robot interaction, which could foster more efficient interactions between humans and robots. |

Previous works often rely on fully observable objects, expert demonstrations, or static grasping poses, which restrict their generalization ability and adaptability to external disturbances. In this paper, we present a reinforcement-learning-based framework that enables zero-shot dynamic dexterous grasping of a wide range of unseen objects from single-view perception, while performing adaptive motions to external disturbances. We utilize a hand-centric object representation for shape feature extraction that emphasizes interaction-relevant local shapes, enhancing robustness to shape variance and uncertainty. To enable effective hand adaptation to disturbances with limited observations, we propose a mixed curriculum learning strategy, which first utilizes imitation learning to distill a policy trained with privileged real-time visual-tactile feedback, and gradually transfers to reinforcement learning to learn adaptive motions under disturbances caused by observation noises and dynamic randomization. Our experiments demonstrate strong generalization in grasping unseen objects with random poses, achieving success rates of 97.0% across 247,786 simulated objects and 94.6% across 512 real objects. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method to various disturbances, including unobserved object movement and external forces, through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

| 2025-04-07 | [Manipulating phases in many-body interacting systems with subsystem resetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05260v1) | Anish Acharya, Rupak Majumder et al. | Stabilizing thermodynamically unstable phases in many-body systems -- such as suppressing pathological neuronal synchronization in Parkinson's disease or maintaining magnetic order across broad temperature ranges -- remains a persistent challenge. In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized through intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing additional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative -- subsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the system, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through resetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few parameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the reset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase diagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span a wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium, mean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder. Despite the challenges posed by memory effects, we obtain explicit analytical predictions, validated by simulations. |
| 2025-04-04 | [SeGuE: Semantic Guided Exploration for Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03629v1) | Cody Simons, Aritra Samanta et al. | The rise of embodied AI applications has enabled robots to perform complex tasks which require a sophisticated understanding of their environment. To enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information. In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily deployed. |
| 2025-04-04 | [Align to Structure: Aligning Large Language Models with Structural Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03622v1) | Zae Myung Kim, Anand Ramachandran et al. | Generating long, coherent text remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs), as they lack hierarchical planning and structured organization in discourse generation. We introduce Structural Alignment, a novel method that aligns LLMs with human-like discourse structures to enhance long-form text generation. By integrating linguistically grounded discourse frameworks into reinforcement learning, our approach guides models to produce coherent and well-organized outputs. We employ a dense reward scheme within a Proximal Policy Optimization framework, assigning fine-grained, token-level rewards based on the discourse distinctiveness relative to human writing. Two complementary reward models are evaluated: the first improves readability by scoring surface-level textual features to provide explicit structuring, while the second reinforces deeper coherence and rhetorical sophistication by analyzing global discourse patterns through hierarchical discourse motifs, outperforming both standard and RLHF-enhanced models in tasks such as essay generation and long-document summarization. All training data and code will be publicly shared at https://github.com/minnesotanlp/struct_align. |

Our mesh generator consists of a graph neural network that distributes and modifies vertices, and a standard Delaunay algorithm to triangulate the vertices. We explore various design choices and evaluate our mesh generator on various tasks including mesh generation, mesh improvement, and producing variable resolution meshes. The learned mesh generator outputs meshes that are comparable to those produced by Triangle and DistMesh, two popular Delaunay-based mesh generators. |

We introduce a hybrid approach that incorporates body-part segmentation into the mesh fitting process, enhancing both human pose estimation and segmentation accuracy. Our method first assigns body part labels to individual points, which then guide a two-step SMPL-X fitting: initial pose and orientation estimation using body part centroids, followed by global refinement of the point cloud alignment. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fitted human mesh can refine body part labels, leading to improved segmentation. Evaluations on the cluttered and noisy real-world datasets InterCap, EgoBody, and BEHAVE show that our approach significantly outperforms prior methods in both pose estimation and segmentation accuracy.

However, accurately assessing training performance remains challenging, particularly for real-world applications, as behavior cloning losses often correlate poorly with actual task success. Consequently, researchers resort to success rate metrics derived from costly and time-consuming real-world evaluations, making the identification of optimal policies and detection of overfitting or underfitting impractical. To address these issues, we propose real-is-sim, a novel behavior cloning framework that incorporates a dynamic digital twin (based on Embodied Gaussians) throughout the entire policy development pipeline: data collection, training, and deployment. By continuously aligning the simulated world with the physical world, demonstrations can be collected in the real world with states extracted from the simulator. The simulator enables flexible state representations by rendering image inputs from any viewpoint or extracting low-level state information from objects embodied within the scene. During training, policies can be directly evaluated within the simulator in an offline and highly parallelizable manner. Finally, during deployment, policies are run within the simulator where the real robot directly tracks the simulated robot's joints, effectively decoupling policy execution from real hardware and mitigating traditional domain-transfer challenges. We validate real-is-sim on the PushT manipulation task, demonstrating strong correlation between success rates obtained in the simulator and real-world evaluations. Videos of our system can be found at https://realissim.rai-inst.com. |
| 2025-04-03 | [Concept Lancet: Image Editing with Compositional Representation Transplant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02828v1) | Jinqi Luo, Tianjiao Ding et al. | Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks. Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. Experiments on multiple diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency preservation. |

This flexibility holds particular promise across medicine, where expert-annotated data is scarce. Yet, VLMs' practical utility in intervention-focused domains--especially surgery, where decision-making is subjective and clinical scenarios are variable--remains uncertain. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of 11 state-of-the-art VLMs across 17 key visual understanding tasks in surgical AI--from anatomy recognition to skill assessment--using 13 datasets spanning laparoscopic, robotic, and open procedures. In our experiments, VLMs demonstrate promising generalizability, at times outperforming supervised models when deployed outside their training setting. In-context learning, incorporating examples during testing, boosted performance up to three-fold, suggesting adaptability as a key strength. Still, tasks requiring spatial or temporal reasoning remained difficult. Beyond surgery, our findings offer insights into VLMs' potential for tackling complex and dynamic scenarios in clinical and broader real-world applications. |

Inspired by workflows using splines in computer animation, our Spline-based Transformers embed an input sequence of elements as a smooth trajectory in latent space. Overcoming drawbacks of positional encoding such as sequence length extrapolation, Spline-based Transformers also provide a novel way for users to interact with transformer latent spaces by directly manipulating the latent control points to create new latent trajectories and sequences. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in comparison to conventional positional encoding on a variety of datasets, ranging from synthetic 2D to large-scale real-world datasets of images, 3D shapes, and animations. |

However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

This technical report presents the first-look evaluation benchmark (named GPT-ImgEval), quantitatively and qualitatively diagnosing GPT-4o's performance across three critical dimensions: (1) generation quality, (2) editing proficiency, and (3) world knowledge-informed semantic synthesis. Across all three tasks, GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both image generation control and output quality, while also showcasing exceptional knowledge reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, based on the GPT-4o's generated data, we propose a classification-model-based approach to investigate the underlying architecture of GPT-4o, where our empirical results suggest the model consists of an auto-regressive (AR) combined with a diffusion-based head for image decoding, rather than the VAR-like architectures. We also provide a complete speculation on GPT-4o's overall architecture. In addition, we conduct a series of analyses to identify and visualize GPT-4o's specific limitations and the synthetic artifacts commonly observed in its image generation. We also present a comparative study of multi-round image editing between GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, and discuss the safety implications of GPT-4o's outputs, particularly their detectability by existing image forensic models. We hope that our work can offer valuable insight and provide a reliable benchmark to guide future research, foster reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in the field of image generation and beyond.

Extending the robot skillset to novel tasks involves gathering an extensive amount of training data for additional tasks. In this paper, we address the problem of teaching new tasks to robots using human demonstration videos for repetitive tasks (e.g., packing). This task requires understanding the human video to identify which object is being manipulated (the pick object) and where it is being placed (the placement slot). In addition, it needs to re-identify the pick object and the placement slots during inference along with the relative poses to enable robot execution of the task. To tackle this, we propose SLeRP, a modular system that leverages several advanced visual foundation models and a novel slot-level placement detector Slot-Net, eliminating the need for expensive video demonstrations for training. We evaluate our system using a new benchmark of real-world videos. The evaluation results show that SLeRP outperforms several baselines and can be deployed on a real robot. |

Such techniques have significantly bridged the gap between reasoning and standard LLMs on coding tasks. Despite this, much of the progress on distilling reasoning models remains locked behind proprietary datasets or lacks details on data curation, filtering and subsequent training. To address this, we construct a superior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset that we use to achieve state-of-the-art coding capability results in models of various sizes. Our distilled models use only SFT to achieve 61.8% on LiveCodeBench and 24.6% on CodeContests, surpassing alternatives trained with reinforcement learning. We then perform analysis on the data sources used to construct our dataset, the impact of code execution filtering, and the importance of instruction/solution diversity. We observe that execution filtering negatively affected benchmark accuracy, leading us to prioritize instruction diversity over solution correctness. Finally, we also analyze the token efficiency and reasoning patterns utilized by these models. We will open-source these datasets and distilled models to the community. |

Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both the NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the CARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Traditional optimization methods like reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms struggle with deceptive fitness landscapes, where following immediate improvements leads to suboptimal solutions. Quality-diversity (QD) algorithms offer a promising approach by maintaining diverse intermediate solutions as stepping stones for escaping local optima. However, QD algorithms require domain expertise to define hand-crafted features, limiting their applicability where characterizing solution diversity remains unclear. In this paper, we show that unsupervised QD algorithms - specifically the AURORA framework, which learns features from sensory data - efficiently solve deceptive optimization problems without domain expertise. By enhancing AURORA with contrastive learning and periodic extinction events, we propose AURORA-XCon, which outperforms all traditional optimization baselines and matches, in some cases even improving by up to 34%, the best QD baseline with domain-specific hand-crafted features. This work establishes a novel application of unsupervised QD algorithms, shifting their focus from discovering novel solutions toward traditional optimization and expanding their potential to domains where defining feature spaces poses challenges. |

However, the complex optical environment and the limited resources of underwater equipment pose significant challenges to achieving high accuracy and low power consumption. To address these issues, we propose Spiking Underwater YOLO (SU-YOLO), a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model. Leveraging the lightweight and energy-efficient properties of SNNs, SU-YOLO incorporates a novel spike-based underwater image denoising method based solely on integer addition, which enhances the quality of feature maps with minimal computational overhead. In addition, we introduce Separated Batch Normalization (SeBN), a technique that normalizes feature maps independently across multiple time steps and is optimized for integration with residual structures to capture the temporal dynamics of SNNs more effectively. The redesigned spiking residual blocks integrate the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with the YOLO architecture to mitigate spike degradation and enhance the model's feature extraction capabilities. Experimental results on URPC2019 underwater dataset demonstrate that SU-YOLO achieves mAP of 78.8% with 6.97M parameters and an energy consumption of 2.98 mJ, surpassing mainstream SNN models in both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. These results underscore the potential of SNNs for engineering applications. The code is available in https://github.com/lwxfight/snn-underwater. |

UniOcc unifies data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and high-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), which provides 2D/3D occupancy labels with per-voxel flow annotations and support for cooperative autonomous driving. In terms of evaluation, unlike existing studies that rely on suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel metrics that do not depend on ground-truth occupancy, enabling robust assessment of additional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data and explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and forecasting performance. |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling, and RL robustness against noisy signals. |

In this paper, we demonstrate that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks, including instruction following on IFEval, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SORRY-Bench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs. |

Simulation has great potential in supplementing large-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and automated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior datasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it to the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality gap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of simulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown this strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one trained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community lacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes to reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work presents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve vision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from comprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various simulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a humanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance real-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences between the simulation and real-world data.

| 2025-03-28 | [Q-Insight: Understanding Image Quality via Visual Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22679v1) | Weiqi Li, Xuanyu Zhang et al. | Image quality assessment (IQA) focuses on the perceptual visual quality of images, playing a crucial role in downstream tasks such as image reconstruction, compression, and generation. The rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly broadened the scope of IQA, moving toward comprehensive image quality understanding that incorporates content analysis, degradation perception, and comparison reasoning beyond mere numerical scoring. Previous MLLM-based methods typically either generate numerical scores lacking interpretability or heavily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using large-scale annotated datasets to provide descriptive assessments, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this paper, we propose Q-Insight, a reinforcement learning-based model built upon group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which demonstrates strong visual reasoning capability for image quality understanding while requiring only a limited amount of rating scores and degradation labels. By jointly optimizing score regression and degradation perception tasks with carefully designed reward functions, our approach effectively exploits their mutual benefits for enhanced performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Insight substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both score regression and degradation perception tasks, while exhibiting impressive zero-shot generalization to comparison reasoning tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/lwq20020127/Q-Insight. |
| 2025-03-28 | [Verifying Nonlinear Neural Feedback Systems using Polyhedral Enclosures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22660v1) | Samuel I. Akinwande, Chelsea Sidrane et al. | As dynamical systems equipped with neural network controllers (neural feedback systems) become increasingly prevalent, it is critical to develop methods to ensure their safe operation. Verifying safety requires extending control theoretic analysis methods to these systems. Although existing techniques can efficiently handle linear neural feedback systems, relatively few scalable methods address the nonlinear case. We propose a novel algorithm for forward reachability analysis of nonlinear neural feedback systems. The approach leverages the structure of the nonlinear transition functions of the systems to compute tight polyhedral enclosures (i.e., abstractions). These enclosures, combined with the neural controller, are then encoded as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Optimizing this MILP yields a sound over-approximation of the forward-reachable set. We evaluate our algorithm on representative benchmarks and demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement over the current state of the art. |

Where existing approaches search for simulations violating a formal specification or maximizing a notion of coverage, in this work we propose a new goal for testing: to discover unknown rare behaviors by examining discrete mode sequences. We assume a CPS simulator outputs mode information, and strive to explore the sequences of modes produced by varying the initial state or time-varying uncertainties. We hypothesize that rare mode sequences are often the most interesting to a designer, and we develop two accelerated sampling algorithms that speed up the process of finding such sequences. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, ranging from synthetic examples to Simulink diagrams of a CPS, demonstrating in some cases a speedup of over 100x compared with a random sampling strategy. |
| 2025-03-28 | [Empirical Analysis of Sim-and-Real Cotraining Of Diffusion Policies For Planar Pushing from Pixels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22634v1) | Adam Wei, Abhinav Agarwal et al. | In imitation learning for robotics, cotraining with demonstration data generated both in simulation and on real hardware has emerged as a powerful recipe to overcome the sim2real gap. This work seeks to elucidate basic principles of this sim-and-real cotraining to help inform simulation design, sim-and-real dataset creation, and policy training. Focusing narrowly on the canonical task of planar pushing from camera inputs enabled us to be thorough in our study. These experiments confirm that cotraining with simulated data \emph{can} dramatically improve performance in real, especially when real data is limited. Performance gains scale with simulated data, but eventually plateau; real-world data increases this performance ceiling. The results also suggest that reducing the domain gap in physics may be more important than visual fidelity for non-prehensile manipulation tasks. Perhaps surprisingly, having some visual domain gap actually helps the cotrained policy -- binary probes reveal that high-performing policies learn to distinguish simulated domains from real. We conclude by investigating this nuance and mechanisms that facilitate positive transfer between sim-and-real. In total, our experiments span over 40 real-world policies (evaluated on 800+ trials) and 200 simulated policies (evaluated on 40,000+ trials). |

Aaron McClendon, Vishaal Venkatesh et al. | In modern ML Ops environments, model deployment is a critical process that traditionally relies on static heuristics such as validation error comparisons and A/B testing. However, these methods require human intervention to adapt to real-world deployment challenges, such as model drift or unexpected performance degradation. We investigate whether reinforcement learning, specifically multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms, can dynamically manage model deployment decisions more effectively. Our approach enables more adaptive production environments by continuously evaluating deployed models and rolling back underperforming ones in real-time. We test six model selection strategies across two real-world datasets and find that RL based approaches match or exceed traditional methods in performance. Our findings suggest that reinforcement learning (RL)-based model management can improve automation, reduce reliance on manual interventions, and mitigate risks associated with post-deployment model failures. |

However, existing methods face challenges in providing sufficient scene representation, capturing structural information, and maintaining global consistency in scenes emerging significant movement or being forgotten. To this end, we present HS-SLAM to tackle these problems. To enhance scene representation capacity, we propose a hybrid encoding network that combines the complementary strengths of hash-grid, tri-planes, and one-blob, improving the completeness and smoothness of reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce structural supervision by sampling patches of non-local pixels rather than individual rays to better capture the scene structure. To ensure global consistency, we implement an active global bundle adjustment (BA) to eliminate camera drifts and mitigate accumulative errors. Experimental results demonstrate that HS-SLAM outperforms the baselines in tracking and reconstruction accuracy while maintaining the efficiency required for robotics. |
| 2025-03-27 | [Video-R1: Reinforcing Video Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21776v1) | Kaituo Feng, Kaixiong Gong et al. | Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for eliciting video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-COT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 35.8% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o. All codes, models, data are released. |

Optically probing and controlling them can reveal important information such as symmetry and dynamics, but have so far been challenging due to the small energy gap compared to optical wavelengths. Here, we report near infrared optical control of orbital magnetism and associated anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in a magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) on monolayer WSe$_2$ device. We show that the properties of the AHE, such as hysteresis and amplitude, can be controlled by light near integer moir\'e fillings, where spontaneous ferromagnetism exists. By modulating the light helicity, we observe periodic modulation of the transverse resistance in a wide range of fillings, indicating light induced orbital magnetization through a large inverse Faraday effect. At the transition between metallic and AHE regimes, we also reveal large and random switching of the Hall resistivity, which are attributed to optical control of percolating cluster of magnetic domains. Our results open the door to optical manipulation of correlation and topology in MATBG and related structures. |

Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted. Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems. |

While recent works equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities, they suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their effectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries without excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction framework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length. Specifically, we first leverage an LRM to generate deliberate thinking, then select an action from a predefined action space (Search and Finish). For Search action, a query is executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation to guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is chosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach outperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA. Further analysis highlights its strong reflective ability to recognize errors and refine its reasoning trajectory. Our study enhances LRMs' factuality while effectively integrating robust reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). |
